      Marcelin, is a trip to the Pyrenees; I have been there, and that is a
      praiseworthy circumstance; many writers, including some of the
      longest-winded, have described these scenes without leaving home.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I have serious shortcomings to confess, and am deeply humbled
      thereat. I have not been the first to scale any inaccessible mountain; I
      have broken neither leg nor arm; I have not been eaten by the bears; I
      have neither saved any English heiress from being swept away by the Gave,
      nor yet have I married one; I have not been present at a single duel; my
      experiences include no tragic encounter with brigands or smugglers. I have
      walked much, and talked a little, and now I recount the pleasures of my
      eyes and ears. What sort of a man can he be who comes home from a long
      absence bringing all his limbs with him, is not the least in the world a
      hero, and yet does not blush to confess it? In this book I have talked as
      if with thee. There is a Marcelin whom the public knows, a shrewd critic,
      a caustic wit, the lover and delineator of every worldly elegance; there
      is another Marcelin, known to but three or four, a learned and thoughtful
      man. If there are any good ideas in this work, half of them belong to him;
      to him, then, I restore them.

      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he river is so
      fine, that before going to Bayonne I have come down as far as Royan. Ships
      heavy with white sails ascend slowly on both sides of the boat. At each
      gust of wind they incline like idle birds, lifting their long wing and
      showing their black belly. They run slantwise, then come back; one would
      say that they felt the better for being in this great fresh-water harbor;
      they loiter in it and enjoy its peace after leaving the wrath and
      inclemency of the ocean. The banks, fringed with pale verdure, glide right
      and left, far away to the verge of heaven; the river is broad like a sea;
      at this distance you might think you saw two hedges; the trees dimly lift
      their delicate shapes in a robe of bluish gauze; here and there great
      pines raise their umbrellas on the <span class="pagenum">[004]</span><a
      name="link004" id="link004"></a>vapory horizon, where all is confused and
      vanishing; there is an inexpressible sweetness in these first hues of the
      timid day, softened still by the fog which exhales from the deep river. As
      for the river itself, its waters stretch out joyous and splendid; the
      rising sun pours upon its breast a long streamlet of gold; the breeze
      covers it with scales; its eddies stretch themselves, and tremble like an
      awaking serpent, and, when the billow heaves them, you seem to see the
      striped flanks, the taw-ney cuirass of a leviathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, at such moments it seems that the water must live and feel; it has
      a strange look, when it comes, transparent and sombre, to stretch itself
      upon a beach of pebbles; it turns about them as if uneasy and irritated;
      it beats them with its wavelets; it covers them, then retires, then comes
      back again with a sort of languid writhing and mysterious lovingness; its
      snaky eddies, its little crests suddenly beaten down or broken, its wave,
      sloping, shining, then all at once blackened, resembles the flashes of
      passion in an impatient mother, who hovers incessantly and anxiously about
      her children, and covers them, not knowing what she wants and what fears.
      Presently a cloud has covered the heavens, and the wind has risen. In a
      moment the river has assumed the aspect of a crafty and savage animal. It
      hollowed itself, and <span class="pagenum">[005]</span><a name="link005"
      id="link005"></a>showed its livid belly; it came against the keel with
      convulsive starts, hugged it, and dashed against it, as if to try its
      force; as far as one could see, its waves lifted themselves and crowded
      together, like the muscles upon a chest; over the flank of the waves
      passed flashes with sinister smiles; the mast groaned, and the trees bent
      shivering, like a nerveless crowd before the wrath of a fearful beast.

      Then all was hushed; the sun has burst forth, the waves were smoothed, you
      now saw only a laughing expanse; spun out over this polished back a
      thousand greenish tresses sported wantonly; the light rested on it, like a
      diaphanous mantle; it followed the supple movements and the twisting of
      those liquid arms; it folded around <span class="pagenum">[006]</span><a
      name="link006" id="link006"></a>them, behind them, its radiant, azure
      robe; it took their caprices and their mobile colors; the river meanwhile,
      slumbrous in its great, peaceful bed, was stretched out at the feet of the
      hills, which looked down upon it, like it immovable and eternal.

      The boat is made fast to a boom, under a pile of white houses: it is
      Royan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here already are the sea and the dunes; the right of the village is buried
      under a mass of sand; there are crumbling hills, little dreary valleys,
      where you are lost as if in the desert; no sound, no movement, no life;
      scanty, leafless vegetation dots the moving soil, and its filaments fall
      like sickly hairs; small shells, white and empty, cling to these in
      chaplets, and, wherever the foot is set, they crack with a sound like a
      cricket&rsquo;s chirp; this place is the ossuary of some wretched maritime
      tribe. One tree alone can live here, the pine, a wild creature, inhabitant
      of the forests and sterile coasts; there is a whole colony of them here;
      they crowd together fraternally, and cover the sand with their brown
      lamels; the monotonous breeze which sifts through them forever awakes
      their murmur; thus they chant in a plaintive fashion, but with a far
      softer and more harmonious voice <span class="pagenum">[008]</span><a
      name="link008" id="link008"></a><br /> <span class="pagenum">[009]</span><a
      name="link009" id="link009"></a> than the other trees; this voice
      resembles the grating of the cicadæ when in August they sing with all
      their heart among the stalks of the ripened wheat.

      At the left of the village, a footpath winds to the summit of a wasted
      bank, among billows of standing grasses. The river is so broad that the
      other shore is not distinguishable. The sea, its neighbor, imparts its
      refluence; its long undulations come one after another against the coast,
      and pour their little cascades of foam upon the sand; then the water
      retires, running down the slope until it meets a new wave coming up which
      covers it; these billows are never wearied, and their come and go remind
      one of the regular <span class="pagenum">[010]</span><a name="link010"
      id="link010"></a>breathing of a slumbering child. For night has fallen,
      the tints of purple grow brown and fade away. The river goes to rest in
      the soft, vague shadow; scarcely, at long intervals, a remnant glimmer is
      reflected from a slanting wave; obscurity drowns everything in its vapory
      dust; the drowsy eye vainly searches in this mist some visible point, and
      distinguishes at last, like a dim star, the lighthouse of Cordouan.

      The next evening, a fresh sea-breeze has brought us to Bordeaux. The
      enormous city heaps its monumental houses along the river like bastions;
      the red sky is embattled by their coping. They on one hand, the bridge on
      the other, protect, with a double line, the port where the vessels <span
      class="pagenum">[011]</span><a name="link011" id="link011"></a>are crowded
      together like a flock of gulls; those graceful hulls, those tapering
      masts, those sails swollen or floating, weave the labyrinth of their
      movements and forms upon the magnificent purple of the sunset. The sun
      sinks down into the midst of the river and sets it all ablaze; the black
      rigging, the round hulls, stand out against its conflagration, and look
      like jewels of jet set in gold. <span class="pagenum">[012]</span><a

      flowing the resinous blood which chokes it; the powerful liquor still

      Beyond, the monotonous plain of the ferns, bathed in light, stretches away
      as far as the eye can reach. Their green fans expand beneath the sun which
      colors, but does not cause them to fade. Upon the horizon a few scattered
      trees lift their slender columns. You see now and then the silhouette of a
      herdsman on his stilts, inert and standing like a sick heron. Wild horses
      are grazing half hid in the herbage. As the train passes, they abruptly
      lift their great startled eyes and stand motionless, uneasy at the noise
      that has troubled their solitude. Man does not fare well here,&mdash;he
      dies or degenerates; but it is the country of animals, and especially of
      plants. They abound in this desert, free, certain of living. Our pretty,
      cutup valleys are but poor things alongside of these immense spaces,
      leagues upon leagues of marshy or dry vegetation, a level country, where
      nature, elsewhere troubled and tortured by men, still vegetates as in
      primeval days with a calm equal to its grandeur. The sun needs these
      savannas in order properly to spread out its light; from the rising
      exhalation, you feel that the whole plain is <span class="pagenum">[016]</span><a
      name="link016" id="link016"></a> fermenting under its force; and the eyes
      filled by the limitless horizon divine the secret labor by which this
      ocean of rank verdure renews and nourishes itself.

      Night without a moon has come on. The peaceful stars shine like points of
      flame; the whole air is filled with a blue and tender light, which seems
      to sleep in the network of vapor wherein it lies. The eye penetrates it
      without apprehending anything. At long intervals, in this twilight, a wood
      confusedly marks its spot, like a rock at the bottom of a lake; everywhere
      around are vague depths, veiled and floating forms, indistinct and
      fantastic creatures melting into each other, fields that look like a
      billowy sea, clumps of trees that you might take for summer clouds,&mdash;the
      whole graceful chaos of commingled phantoms, of things of the night. The
      mind floats here as on a fleeting stream, and nothing seems to it real, in
      this dream, but the pools which reflect the stars and make on earth a
      second heaven.

      Bayonne is a gay city, original and half Spanish. On all sides are men in
      velvet vest and small-clothes; you hear the sharp, sonorous music of the
      tongue spoken beyond the mountains. Squatty arcades border the principal
      streets; there is need of shade under such a sun.

      A pretty episcopal palace, in its modern elegance, makes the ugly
      cathedral still uglier. The poor, abortive monument piteously lifts its
      belfry, that for three centuries has remained but a stump. Booths are
      stuck in its hollows, after the manner of warts; here and there they have
      laid on a rude plaster of stone. The old invalid is a sad spectacle
      alongside of the new houses and busy shops which crowd around its grimy
      flanks. <span class="pagenum">[018]</span><a name="link018" id="link018"></a>I
      was quite troubled at this decrepitude, and when once I had entered, I
      became still more melancholy. Darkness fell from the vault like a
      winding-sheet; I could make out nothing but o o worm-eaten pillars,
      smoke-darkened pictures, expanses of greenish wall. Two fresh toilettes
      that I met increased the contrast; nothing could shock one more in this
      place than rose-colored ribbons.

      I was looking upon the spectre of the middle ages; how opposed to it are
      the security and abundance of modern life! Those sombre vaults, those
      slender columns, those rose windows, blood-dyed, called up dreams and
      emotions which are now impossible for us. You should feel here what men
      felt six hundred years ago, when they swarmed forth from their hovels,
      from their unpaved, six-feet-wide streets, sinks of uncleanness, and
      reeking with fever and leprosy; when their unclad bodies, undermined by
      famine, sent a thin blood to their brutish brains; when wars, atrocious
      laws, and legends of sorcery filled their dreams with vivid and melancholy
      images; when over the bedizened draperies, over the riddles of painted
      glass, the rose windows, like a conflagration or an aureole, poured their
      transfigured rays.

    <p>
      These are the remembrances of fever and ecstasy: to get rid of them I have

      Here all is gay and picturesque. Serious oxen, with lowered heads, drag
      the beams that are being unloaded. Rope-makers, girt with a wisp of hemp,
      walk backward tightening their threads, and twining their ever-growing
      cable. The ships in file are made fast at the quay; the slender cordage
      outlines its labyrinth against the sky, and the sailors hang in it hooked
      on like spiders in their web. Great casks, bales, pieces of wood are
      strewn pell-mell over the flags.

      You are pleased to feel that man is working and prosperous. And here
      nature too is as happy as man. The broad silver river unrolls itself under
      the radiance of the morning. Slender clouds throw out on the azure their
      band of mother-of-pearl. The sky is like an arch of lapis-lazuli. Its
      vault rests on the confines of the flood which advances waveless and

      It rains: the inn is insupportable. It is stifling under the arcades; I am

      go to the library. That is closed.

      Fortunately the librarian takes pity on me, and opens for me. Better yet,
      he brings me all sorts of charters and old books; he is both very learned
      and very amiable, explains everything to me, guides, informs and installs
      me. Here I am then in a corner, alone at a table, with the documents of a
      fine and thoroughly enjoyable history; it is a pastoral of the middle
      ages. I have nothing better to do than to tell it over for my own benefit.

      Pé de Puyane was a brave man and a skilful sailor, who in his day was
      Mayor of Bayonne and admiral; but he was harsh with his men, like all who
      have managed vessels, and would any day rather fell a man than take off
      his cap. He had long waged war against the seamen of Normandy, and on one
      occasion he hung seventy of them to his yards, cheek <span class="pagenum">[021]</span><a
      name="link021" id="link021"></a>by jowl with some dogs. He hoisted on his
      galleys red flags signifying death and no quarter, and led to the battle
      of Ecluse the great Genoese ship <i>Christophle</i>, and managed his hands
      so well that no Frenchman escaped; for they were all drowned or killed,
      and the two admirals, Quieret and Bahuchet, having surrendered themselves,
      Bahuchet had a cord tightened around his neck, while Quieret had his
      throat cut. That was good management; for the more one kills of his
      enemies, the less he has of them. For this reason, the people of Bayonne,
      on his return, entertained him with such a noise, such a clatter of horns,
      of cornets, of drums and all sorts of instruments, that it would have been
      impossible on that day to hear even the thunder of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that the Basques would no longer pay the tax upon cider, which
      was brewed at Bayonne for sale in their country. Pe de Puyane said that
      the merchants of the city should carry them no more, and that, if any one
      carried them any, he should have his hand cut off. Pierre Cambo, indeed, a
      poor man, having carted two hogsheads of it by night, was led out upon the
      market-place, before Notre Dame de Saint-Léon, which was then building,
      and had his hand amputated, and the veins afterwards stopped with red-hot
      irons; after that he was driven in a tumbrel throughout the city, <span
      class="pagenum">[022]</span><a name="link022" id="link022"></a>which was
      an excellent example; for the smaller folk should always do the bidding of
      men in high position.

      Afterwards, Pé de Puyane having assembled the hundred peers in the
      town-house, showed them that the Basques being traitors, rebels toward the
      seigniory of Bayonne, should no longer keep the franchises which had been
      granted them; that the seigniory of Bayonne, possessing the sovereignty of
      the sea, might with justice impose a tax in all the places to which the
      sea rose, as if they were in its port, and that accordingly the Basques
      should henceforth <span class="pagenum">[023]</span><a name="link023"
      id="link023"></a>pay for passing to Villefranche, to the bridge of the
      Nive, the limit of high tide. All cried out that that was but just, and Pé
      de Puyane declared the toll to the Basques; but they all fell to laughing,
      saying they were not dogs of sailors like the mayor&rsquo;s subjects. Then
      having come in force, they beat the bridgemen, and left three of them for
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pé said nothing, for he was no great talker; but he clinched his teeth,
      and looked so terribly around him, that none dared ask him what he would
      do, nor urge him on, nor indeed breathe a word. From the first Saturday in
      April to the middle of August, several men were beaten, as well Bayonnais
      as Basques, but still war was not declared, and, when they talked of it to
      the mayor, he turned his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twenty-fourth day of August, many noblemen among the Basques, and
      several young people, good leapers and dancers, came to the castle of Miot
      for the festival of Saint Bartholomew. They feasted and showed off the
      whole day, and the young people who jumped the pole, with their red sashes
      and white breeches, appeared adroit and handsome. That night came a man
      who talked low to the mayor, and he, who ordinarily wore a grave and
      judicial air, suddenly had eyes as bright as those of a youth who sees the
      coming of his bride. He went down his staircase with four bounds, led out
      a band of old sailors who were come one by one, covertly, <span
      class="pagenum">[024]</span><a name="link024" id="link024"></a>into the
      lower hall, and set out by dark night with several of the wardens, having
      closed the gates of the city for fear that some traitor, such as there are
      everywhere, should go before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived at the castle they found the drawbridge down and the
      postern open, so confident and unsuspecting were the Basques, and entered,
      cutlasses drawn and pikes forward, into the great hall. There were killed
      seven young men who had barricaded themselves behind tables, and would
      there make sport with their dirks; but the good halberds, well pointed and
      sharp as they were, soon silenced them. The others, having closed the
      gates from within, thought that they would have power to defend themselves
      or time to flee; but the Bayonne marines, with their great axes, hewed
      down the planks, and split the first brains which happened to be near. The
      mayor, seeing that the Basques were tightly girt with their red sashes,
      went about saying (for he was usually facetious on days of battle):
      &ldquo;Lard these fine gallants for me; forward the spit into their flesh
      justicoats;&rdquo; and in fact the spits went forward, so that all were
      perforated and opened, some through and through, so that you might have
      seen daylight through them, and that the hall half an hour after was full
      of pale and red bodies, several bent over benches, others in a pile in the
      corners, some with their noses glued to the table like drunkards, <span
      class="pagenum">[025]</span><a name="link025" id="link025"></a> so that a
      Bayonnais, looking at them, said: &ldquo;This is the veal market.&rdquo;
      Many, pricked from behind, had leaped through the windows, and were found
      next morning, with cleft head or broken spine, in the ditches.

    <p>
      There remained only five men alive, noblemen, two named d&rsquo;Urtubie,
      two de Saint-Pé, and one, de Lahet, whom the mayor had set aside as a
      precious commodity; then, having sent some one to open the gates of
      Bayonne and command the people to come, he ordered them to set fire to the
      castle. It was a fine sight, for the castle burned from midnight until
      morning; as each turret, wall or floor fell, the people, delighted, raised
      a great shout. <span class="pagenum">[026]</span><a name="link026"
      id="link026"></a>There were volleys of sparks in the smoke and flames that
      stopped short, then began again suddenly, as at public rejoicings; so that
      the warden, an honorable advocate, and a great literary man, uttered this
      saying: &ldquo;Fine festival for Bayonne folk; for the Basques great
      barbecue of hogs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle being burned, the mayor said to the five noblemen that he
      wished to deal with them with all friendliness, and that they should
      themselves be judges, if the tide came as far as the bridge; then he had
      them fastened two by two to the arches until the tide should rise,
      assuring them that they were in a good place for seeing. The people were
      all on the bridge and along the banks, watching the swelling of the flood.
      Little by little it mounted to their breasts, then to their necks, and
      they threw back their heads so as to lift their mouths a little higher.
      The people laughed aloud, calling out to them that the time for drinking
      had come, as with the monks at matins, and that they would have enough for
      the rest of their days. Then the water entered the mouth and nose of the
      three who were lowest; their throats gurgled as when bottles are filled,
      and the people applauded, saying that the drunkards swallowed too fast,
      and were going to strangle themselves out of pure greediness. There
      remained only the two men, <span class="pagenum">[027]</span><a
      name="link027" id="link027"></a>d&rsquo;Urtubie, bound to the principal
      arch, father and son, the son a little lower down. When the father saw his
      child choking, he stretched out his arms with such force that a cord
      broke: but that was all, and the hemp cut into his flesh without his being
      able to get any further. Those above, seeing that the youth&rsquo;s eyes
      were rolling, while the veins on his forehead were purple and swollen, and
      that the water bubbled around him with his hiccough, called him baby, and
      asked why he had sucked so hard, and if nurse was not coming soon to put
      him to bed. At this the father cried out like a wolf, spat into the air at
      them, and called them butchers and cowards. That offended them so that
      they began throwing stones at him with such sure aim that his white head
      was soon reddened and his right eye gushed out; it was small loss to him,
      for shortly after, the mounting wave shut up the other. When the water was
      gone down, the mayor commanded that the five bodies, which hung with necks
      twisted and limp, should be left a testimony to the Basques that the water
      of Bayonne did come up to the bridge, and that the toll was justly due
      from them. He then returned home amidst the acclamations of his people,
      who were delighted that they had so good a mayor, a sensible man, a great
      lover of justice, quick in wise enterprises, and who rendered to every man
      his due. <span class="pagenum">[028]</span><a name="link028" id="link028"></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was setting out, he had put sixty men at the entrance of the bridge,
      in the toll-tower, ordering them to look out well for themselves, and
      warning them that the Basques would not be slow in seeking to avenge
      themselves. But they flattered themselves that they still had at least one
      good night, and they busied their throats mightily with emptying flagons.
      Towards the middle of the night, there being no moon, came up about two
      hundred Basques; for they are alert as the antelope,* and their runners
      had awakened that morning more than twenty villages in the Soule with the
      story of fire and drowning. The younger men, with several older heads, had
      set out forthwith by crooked circuitous paths, barefoot, that they might
      make no noise, well armed with cutlasses, crampoons and several slender
      rope-ladders; and, adroit as foxes, they had stolen to the base of the
      tower, to a place on the eastern side where it plunges straight down to
      the bed of the river, a real quagmire, so that here there was no guard,
      and the rolling of the water on the pebbles might drown their slight
      noise, should they make any. They fixed their crampoons in the crannies of
      the stones, and, little by little, Jean Amacho, a man from Béhobie, a
      noted hunter of<span class="pagenum">[029]</span><a name="link029"
      id="link029"></a>mountain beasts, climbed upon the battlements of the
      first wall, then, having steadied a pole against a window of the tower, he
      entered and hooked on two ladders; the others mounted in their turn, until
      there were about fifty of them; and new men were constantly coming, as
      many as the ladders would bear, noiselessly striding over the window-sill.

      They were in a little, low ante-room, and from thence, in the great hall
      of the first floor, six steps below them, they beheld the Bayonnais, of
      whom there were but three in this place, two asleep, and a third who had
      just waked up and was rubbing his eyes, with his back turned to the small
      door of the ante-room. Jean Amacho gave a sign to the two men who had
      mounted immediately after him, and all jumped together with a single leap,
      and so nicely that, at the same moment, their three knives pierced the
      throats of the Bayonnais, who, bowing their limbs, sank without a cry to
      the ground. The other Basques then came in, and waited at the verge of the
      great balustraded staircase leading into the lower hall where were the
      Bayonnais, some in a heap sleeping near the fireplace, others calling out
      and sharpset at feasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these feeling that his hair was moist, lifted his head, saw some
      little red streams running from between the joists of the ceiling, and
      began to laugh, saying that the greedy fellows up there could no <span
      class="pagenum">[030]</span><a name="link030" id="link030"></a>longer hold
      their cups, and were wasting good wine, which was very wrong of them. But
      finding that this wine was quite warm, he took some on his finger, then
      touched his tongue, and saw, by the insipid taste, that it was blood. He
      proclaimed this aloud, and the Bayonnais starting up grasped their pikes
      and ran for the staircase. Thereupon the Basques who had waited, not being
      sufficiently numerous, wished to recover the moment and rushed forth; but
      the first comers felt the point of the pikes, and were lifted, just as
      bundles of hay are spitted on the forks to be thrown into a loft; then the
      Bayonnais, holding themselves close together, and bristling in front with
      pikes, began to mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a valiant Basque, Antoine Chaho, and two others with him,
      dropped down along the wall, lizard fashion, making a cover of dead
      bodies; and gliding between the great legs of the sailors of Bayonne,
      began work with their knives upon their hamstrings; so that the Bayonnais,
      wedged in the stairway, and embarrassed by the men and the pikes that were
      falling crosswise, could neither get on nor wield their spits with such
      nicety. At this moment, Jean Amacho and several young Basques, having
      espied their moment, leaped more than twenty feet clear into the middle of
      the hall, to a place where no halberds were ready, and began cutting
      throats with great promptness, then, thrown upon their <span
      class="pagenum">[031]</span><a name="link031" id="link031"></a>knees, fell
      to ripping open bellies; they killed far more than they lost, because they
      had deft hands, while many were well padded with wool and wore leather
      shirts, and besides, the handles to their knives were wound with cord and
      did not slip. Moreover the Basques from above, who now numbered more than
      a hundred, rolled down the staircase like a torrent of goats; new ones
      came up every moment, and in every corner of the hall, man to man, they
      began to run each other through.
    </p>
    <p>
      There died Jean Amacho in a sad enough fashion, and from no fault of his
      own; for after he had cut the throat of a Bayonnais,&mdash;his ordinary
      mode of killing, and, indeed, the best of all,&mdash;he held his head too
      near, and the jet from the two great veins of the neck spirted into his
      face like the froth from a jar of perry as it is uncorked, and suddenly
      shut up both his eyes; accordingly he was unable to avoid a Bayonnais who
      was at his left; the fellow planted his dagger in Jean&rsquo;s back, who
      spit out blood, and died a minute after.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Bayonnais, who were less numerous and less adroit, could make no
      stand, and at the end of half an hour there remained only a dozen of them,
      driven into a corner near a little cellar where were kept the jugs and
      bottles. In order the sooner to reduce these, the Basques gathered
      together the pikes, and began driving through this heap of men; <span
      class="pagenum">[032]</span><a name="link032" id="link032"></a>and the
      Bayonnais, as anybody will on feeling an iron point prick through his
      skin, stepped back and rolled together into the cellar. Just at this
      moment the torches went out, and the Basques, in order not to wound each
      other, dressed the whole armful of pikes, and harpooned at random forward
      into the cellar during more than a quarter of an hour, so as to make sure
      that no Bayonnais remained alive; and thus, when all was become tranquil,
      and the torches were relighted, and they looked in, they saw that the
      cellar resembled a pork-butcher&rsquo;s chopping-block, the bodies being
      cut in twenty places, and separated from their heads, and the limbs being
      confusedly thrown together, till only salt was wanting to make a
      salting-tub of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the younger of the Basques, although there was nothing more to kill,
      rolled their eyes all around the hall, grinding their teeth like hounds
      after the quarry; they cried aloud continually, trembling in their limbs
      and clenching their fingers after the handles of their daggers; several,
      wounded and whitelipped, no longer felt their wounds or their loss of
      blood, remained crouching beside the man they had last killed, and then
      involuntarily leaped to their feet. One or two laughed with the fixity of
      madmen, and varied this with a hoarse roar; and there was in the room such
      a mist of carnage that any one seeing <span class="pagenum">[033]</span><a
      name="link033" id="link033"></a>them reeling or howling thus, might have
      believed them drunk with wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunrise, when they had loosed the five drowned men from the arches,
      they cast all the Bayonnais upon the current of the stream, and said that
      they might go down thus to their sea, and that this cartful of dead flesh
      was such toll as the Basques would pay. The congealed wounds were opened
      again by the coldness of the water; it was a fine sight: by means of the
      blood that flowed, the river blushed red as a morning sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the Basques and the men of Bayonne fought several years more,
      man against man, band against band; and many brave men died on both sides.
      At the end, the two parties agreed to submit to the arbitration of Bernard
      Ezi, <i>Sire d&rsquo;Albret.</i> The lord of Albret said that the men of
      Bayonne, since they had made the first attack, were in fault; he ordained
      that in future the Basques should pay no toll, that, on the contrary, the
      city of Bayonne should pay them fifteen hundred new golden crowns and
      should establish ten priestly prebendaryships, which should cost four
      thousand old crowns of the first coinage of France, of good gold and loyal
      weight, for the repose of the souls of the five gentlemen drowned without
      confession, which, perchance, were in purgatory, and had need of many
      masses in order to get out. But the Basques <span class="pagenum">[034]</span><a
      name="link034" id="link034"></a>were unwilling that Pê de Puyane, the
      mayor, should be included in this peace, either he or his sons, and they
      reserved the right to pursue them until they had taken vengeance on his
      flesh and his race. The mayor retired to Bordeaux, to the house of the
      Prince of Wales, of whom he was a great friend and good servant, and
      during two o o years did not go outside of the city, excepting three or
      four times, well steeled, and attended by men-at-arms. But one day, when
      he had gone to see a vineyard he had bought, he withdrew a little from his
      troop to lift a great black vine-stock which was falling into the ditch; a
      moment after, his men heard a little sharp cry, like that of a thrush
      caught in a snare; when they had run up they saw Pé de Puyane dead, with a
      knife a fathom long which had entered by the armpit where he was
      unprotected by his cuirass. His elder son, Sebastian, who had fled to
      Toulouse, was killed by Augustin de Lahet, nephew of the man who was
      drowned; the other, Hugues, survived and founded a family, since, having
      gone by sea to England, he remained there, and received from King Edward a
      knight&rsquo;s fief. But neither he nor his children ever returned into
      Gascony; they did wisely, for they would have found their grave-diggers
      there. <span class="pagenum">[035]</span><a name="link035" id="link035"></a>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>alf a league off,
      at the turning of a road, may be seen a hill of a singular blue: it is the
      sea. Then you descend, by a winding route, to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      A melancholy village, with the taint of hotels, white and regular, cafés
      and signs, ranged by stages upon the arid coast; for grass, patches of
      poor starveling turf; for trees, frail tamarisks which cling shivering to
      the earth; for harbor, a beach and two empty creeks. The smaller conceals
      in its sandy recess two barks without masts, without sails, to all
      appearance abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waters consume the coast; great pieces of earth and stone, hardened by
      their shock, fifty feet away from the shore, lift their brown and yellow
      spine, worn, raked, gnawed, jagged, scooped out <span class="pagenum">[036]</span><a
      name="link036" id="link036"></a>by the wave, resembling a troop of
      stranded whales. The billow barks or bellows in their hollow bowels, in
      their deep yawning jaws; then, after they have engulfed it, they vomit it
      forth in jets and foam against the lofty shining waves that forever return
      to the assault. Shells and polished pebbles are incrusted upon their head.
      Here furzes have rooted their patient stems and the confusion of their
      thorns; this hairy mantle is the only one capable of clinging to their
      flanks, and of standing out against the spray of the sea.

    <p>
      To the left, a train of ploughed and emaciated rocks stretches out in a
      promontory as far as an <span class="pagenum">[037]</span><a name="link037"
      id="link037"></a>arcade of hardened beach, which the high tides have
      opened, and whence on three sides the eye looks down upon the ocean. Under
      the whistling north wind it bristles with violet waves; the passing clouds
      marble it with still more sombre spots; as far as the eye can reach is a
      sickly agitation of wan waves, chopping and disjointed, a sort of moving
      skin that trembles, wrenched by an inward fever; occasionally a streak of
      foam crossing them marks a more violent shock. Here and there, between the
      intervals of the clouds, the light cuts out a few sea-green fields upon
      the uniform plain; their tawny lustre, their unhealthy color, add to the
      strangeness and to the limits of the horizon. These sinister changing
      lights, these tin-like reflections upon a leaden swell, these white scoriæ
      clinging to the rocks, this slimy aspect of the waves suggest a gigantic
      crucible in which the metal bubbles and gleams.
    </p>
    <p>
      But toward evening the air clears up and the wind falls. The Spanish coast
      is visible, and its chain of mountains softened by distance. The long
      dentation undulates away out of sight, and its misty pyramids at the last
      vanish in the west, between the sky and the ocean. The sea smiles in its
      blue robe, fringed with silver, wrinkled by the last puff of the breeze;
      it trembles still, but with pleasure, and spreads out its lustrous,
      many-hued silk, <span class="pagenum">[038]</span><a name="link038"
      id="link038"></a>with voluptuous caprices beneath the sun that warms it.
      Meanwhile a few serene clouds poise above it their down of snow; the
      transparency of the air bathes them in angelic glory, and their motionless
      flight suggests the souls in Dante stayed in ecstasy at the entrance of
      paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is night; I have come up to a solitary esplanade where is a cross, and
      whence is visible the sea and the coast. The coast, black, sprinkled with
      lights, sinks and rises in indistinct hillocks. The sea mutters and rolls
      with hollow voice. Occasionally, in the midst of this threatening
      breathing comes a hoarse hiccough, as if the slumbering wild beast were
      waking up; you cannot make it out, but from a nameless something that is
      sombre and moving, you divine a monstrous, palpitating back; in its
      presence man is like a child before the lair of a leviathan. Who assures
      us that it will continue to tolerate us to-morrow? On land we feel
      ourselves master; there our hand finds everywhere its traces; it has
      transformed everything and put everything to its service; the soil
      now-a-days is a kitchen-garden, the forests a grove, the rivers trenches,
      Nature is a nurse and a servant. But here still exists something ferocious
      and untamable. The ocean has preserved its liberty and its omnipotence;
      one of its billows would drown our hive; over there in America its bed
      lifts itself; it will <span class="pagenum">[039]</span><a name="link039"
      id="link039"></a>crush us without a thought; it has done it and will do it
      again; just now it slumbers, and we live clinging to its flank without
      dreaming that it sometimes wants to turn itself about.

      Do not look to the left; the pickets of soldiers, the huts of the bathers,
      the ennuyés, the children, the invalids, the drying linen, it is all as
      melancholy as a caserne and a hospital. But at the foot of the light-house
      the beautiful green waves hollow themselves and scale the rocks,
      scattering upon the wind their plume of foam; the billows come up to the
      assault and mount one upon another, as agile and hardy as charging
      horsemen; the caverns rumble; the breeze whispers with a happy sound; it
      enters the breast and expands the muscles; you fill your lungs with the
      invigorating saltness of the sea. <span class="pagenum">[041]</span><a
      name="link041" id="link041"></a>Farther on, ascending towards the north,
      are paths creeping along the cliffs. At the bottom of the last, solitude
      opens out; everything human has disappeared; neither houses, nor culture,
      nor verdure. It is here as in the first ages, at a time when man had not
      yet appeared, and when the water, the stone, and the sand were the sole
      inhabitants of the universe. The coast stretches into the vapor its long
      strip of polished sand; the gilded beach undulates softly and opens its
      hollows to the ripples of the sea. Each ripple comes up foamy at first,
      then insensibly smooths itself, leaves behind it the flocks of its white
      fleece, and goes to sleep upon the shore it has kissed. Meanwhile another
      approaches, and beyond that again a new one, then a whole troop, striping
      the bluish water with embroidery of silver. They whisper low, and you
      scarcely hear them under the outcry of the distant billows; nowhere is the
      beach so sweet, so smiling&mdash;the land softens its embrace the better
      to receive and caress those darling creatures, which are, as it were, the
      little children of the sea.

      It has rained all night; but this morning a brisk wind has dried the
      earth; and I have come along the coast to Saint-Jean-de-Luz. <span

      Everywhere the wasted cliffs drop perpendicularly down; dreary hillocks,
      crumbling sand; miserable grasses that strike their filaments into the
      moving soil; streamlets that vainly wind and are choked, pushed back by
      the sea; tortured inlets, and naked strands. The ocean tears and
      depopulates its beach. Everything suffers from the neighborhood of the old
      tyrant. As you contemplate here its aspect and its work, the antique
      superstitions seem true. It is a melancholy and hostile god, forever
      thundering, sinister, sudden in caprice, whom nothing appeases, nothing
      subdues, who chafes at being kept back from the land, <span class="pagenum">[043]</span><a
      name="link043" id="link043"></a>embraces it impatiently, feels it and
      shakes it, and to-morrow may recapture it or break it in pieces. Its
      violent waves start convulsively and twist themselves, clashing like the
      heads of a great troop of wild horses; a sort of grizzling mane streams on
      the edge of the black horizon; the gulls scream; they are seen darting
      down into the valley that is scooped out between two surges, then
      reappearing; they turn and look strangely at you with their pale eyes. One
      would say that they are delighted with this tumult and are awaiting a
      prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little farther on, a poor hut hides itself in a bay. Three children
      ragged, with naked legs, were playing there in a stream that was
      overflown. A great moth, clogged by the rain, had fallen into a hole. They
      conducted the water to it with their feet, and dabbled in the cold mud;
      the rain fell in showers on the poor creature, which vainly beat its
      wings; they laughed boisterously, stumbling about and holding on to each
      other with their red hands. At that age and amidst such privation nothing
      more was wanting to make them happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road ascends and descends, winding on high hills which denote the
      neighborhood of the Pyrenees. The sea reappears at each turn, and it is a
      singular spectacle, this suddenly lowered horizon, and that greenish
      triangle broadening toward <span class="pagenum">[044]</span><a
      name="link044" id="link044"></a>heaven. Two or three villages stretch
      along the route, their houses dropping down the heights like flights of
      stairs. From the white houses the women come out in black gown and veil to
      go to mass. The sombre color announces Spain. The men, in velvet vests,
      crowd to the public house and drink coffee in silence. Poor houses, a poor
      country; under a shed I have seen them cooking, in the guise of bread,
      cakes of maize and barley. This destitution is always touching. What is it
      that a day-laborer has gained by our thirty centuries of civilization? Yet
      he has gained, and when we accuse ourselves, it is because we forget
      history. He no longer has the small-pox, or the leprosy; he no longer dies
      of hunger, as in the sixteenth century, under Montluc; he is no longer
      burned as a witch, as happened indeed under Henry IV. here in this very
      place; he can, if he is a soldier, learn to read, become an officer; he
      has coffee, sugar, linen. Our descendants will say that that is but
      little; our fathers would have said that it is a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Jean-de-Luz is a little old city with narrow streets, to-day silent
      and decaying; its mariners once fought the Normans for the king of
      England; thirty or forty ships went out every year for the whale-fishery.
      Now-a-days the harbor is empty; this terrible Biscayan sea has thrice
      broken down its dike. Against this roaring surge, heaped up all <span
      class="pagenum">[045]</span><a name="link045" id="link045"></a>the way
      from America, no work of man holds out. The water was engulfed in the
      channel and came like a race-horse high as the quays, lashing the bridges,
      shaking its crests, grooving its wave; then it thundered heavily into the
      basins, sometimes with leaps so abrupt that it fell over the parapets like
      a mill-dam, and flooded the lower part of the houses. One poor boat danced
      in a corner at the end of a rope; no seamen, no rigging, no cordage; such
      is this celebrated harbor. They say, however, that half a league away,
      there are five or six barks in a creek.

      From the dike the tumult of the high tide was visible. A massive wall of
      black clouds girt the horizon; the sun blazed through a crevice like a
      fire through the mouth of a furnace, and overflowed <span class="pagenum">[046]</span><a
      name="link046" id="link046"></a>upon the billow its conflagration of
      ferruginous flames. The sea leaped like a maniac at the entrance of the
      harbor, smitten by a band of invisible rocks, and joined with its white
      line the two horns of the coast. The waves came up fifteen feet high
      against the beach, then, undermined by the falling water, fell head
      foremost, desperate, with frightful howling; they returned however to the
      assault, and mounted each minute higher, leaving on the beach their carpet
      of snowy foam, and fleeing with the slight shivering of a swarm of ants
      foraging among dry leaves. Finally one of them came wetting the feet of
      the men who were watching from the top of the dike. Happily, it was the
      last; the city is twenty feet below, and would be only a mass of ruins if
      some great tide were urged on by a hurricane.

      A noble hotel, with broad halls, and grand antique apartments, displays
      itself at the corner of the first basin facing the sea. Anne of Austria
      lodged there in 1660, at the time of the marriage of Louis XIV.

      Above a chimney is still to be seen the portrait of a princess in the garb
      of a goddess. Were they not goddesses? A tapestried bridge went from this
      house to the little church, sombre and splendid, traversed by balconies of
      black oak, and <span class="pagenum">[048]</span><a name="link048"
      id="link048"></a>loaded with glittering reliquaries. The married pair
      passed through it between two hedges of Swiss and bedizened guards, the
      king all embroidered with gold, with a hat ornamented with diamonds; the
      queen in a mantle of violet velvet sprinkled with fleur-de-lis, and,
      underneath, a habit of white brocade studded with precious stones, a crown
      upon her head.

      There was nothing but processions, entries, pomps and parades. Who of us
      now-a-days would wish to be a grand seigneur on condition of performing at
      this rate? The weariness <span class="pagenum">[049]</span><a
      name="link049" id="link049"></a>of rank would do away with the pleasures
      of rank; one would lose all patience at being an embroidered manikin,
      always exposed to public view and on exhibition. Then, that was the whole
      of life. When M. de Créqui was going to carry to the infanta the presents
      of the king, &ldquo;he had sixty persons in livery in his suite, with a
      great number of noblemen and many friends.&rdquo;

      The eyes took delight in this splendor. Pride was more akin to vanity,
      enjoyments were more on the surface. They needed to display their power in
      order to feel it. The courtly life had applied the mind to ceremonies.
      They <span class="pagenum">[050]</span><a name="link050" id="link050"></a>learned
      to dance, as now-a-days to reflect; they passed whole years at the
      academy; they studied with extreme seriousness and attention the art of
      bowing, of advancing the foot, of holding themselves erect, of playing
      with the sword, of setting the cane properly; the obligation of living in
      public constrained them to it; it was the sign of their rank and
      education; they proved in this way their alliances, their world, their
      place with the king, their title. Better yet, it was the poetry of the
      time. A fine manner of bowing is a fine thing; it recalled a thousand
      souvenirs of authority and of ease, just as in Greece an attitude recalled
      a thousand souvenirs of war and the gymnasium; a slight inclination of the
      neck, a limb nobly extended, a smile complaisant and calm, an ample
      trailing petticoat with majestic folds, filled the soul with lofty and
      courtly thoughts, and these great lords were the first to enjoy the
      spectacle they afforded. &ldquo;I went to carry my offering,&rdquo; said
      Mlle. de Montpensier, &ldquo;and performed my <i>révérences</i> as did no
      one else of the company; I found myself suitable enough for ceremonial
      days; my person held its place there as my name in the world.&rdquo; These
      words explain the infinite attention that was given to questions of
      precedence and to ceremonies; Mademoiselle is inexhaustible on this point;
      she talks like an upholsterer and a chamberlain; she is <span
      class="pagenum">[051]</span><a name="link051" id="link051"></a>uneasy to
      know at what precise moment the Spanish grandees take off their hats; if
      the king of Spain will kiss the queen-mother or will only embrace her:
      these important interests trouble her. In fact, at that time they were
      important interests. Rank did not depend, as in a democracy, upon proved
      worth, on acquired glory, on power exercised or riches displayed, but upon
      visible prerogatives transmitted by inheritance or granted by the king: so
      that they fought for a tabouret or a mantle, as now-a-days for a place or
      for a million. Among other treacheries they plotted to lodge Mademoiselle&rsquo;s
      sisters with the queen. &ldquo;The proposition displeased me; they would
      have eaten with her always, which I did not. That roused my pride. I was
      desperate at that moment.&rdquo; The warfare was yet greater when it came
      to the marriage. &ldquo;It occurred to somebody that it was necessary to
      carry an offering to the queen, so I could not bear her train, and it must
      be my sisters who would carry it with Mme. de Carignan. As soon as there
      was talk of bearing trains, the Duke de Roquelaure had offered to carry
      mine. They sought for dukes to carry those of my sisters, and, as not one
      was willing to do it, Mme. de Saugeon cried aloud that Madame would be in
      despair at this distinction.&rdquo; What happiness to walk first upon the
      tapestried bridge, the train held up by a duke, while, the <span
      class="pagenum">[052]</span><a name="link052" id="link052"></a>others go
      shamefully behind, with a train, but without a duke! But suddenly others
      put in a claim. Mme. d&rsquo;Uzès comes running up in a fright: it is
      question of an atrocious usurpation. &ldquo;The princess palatine will
      have a train; will you not put a stop to that?&rdquo; They get together;
      they go to the king; they represent to him the enormity of the deed: the
      king forbids this new train as usurping and criminal, and the princess,
      who weeps and storms, declares that she will not be present at the
      marriage if they deprive her of her appendix. Alas! all human prosperity
      has its reverses; Mademoiselle, so happy in the matter of trains, could
      not get to kiss the queen, and, at this interdict, she remained all day
      plunged in the deepest grief. But, you see, the pursuits of rank had been,
      from infancy, her sole concern; she had wanted to marry all the princes in
      the world, and ever in vain; the person mattered little to her. First the
      cardinal infante, the reverse of an Amadis; at the age of dreams, on the
      threshold of youth, among the vague visions and first enchantments of
      love, she chose this old churl in a ruff to enthrone herself with him, in
      a fine arm-chair, in the government of the Low Countries. Then Philip IV.
      of Spain; the emperor Ferdinand, the arch-duke: negotiating with them
      herself, exposing her envoy to the risk of hanging. Then the king of
      Hungary, the future king of <span class="pagenum">[053]</span><a
      name="link053" id="link053"></a>England, Louis XIV., Monsieur, the king of

      Who could count them? At a pinch, she went to work in advance: the
      princess of Condé being ill, then in the family way, this romantic head
      fancied that the prince was going to become a widower, and wanted to
      retain him for a husband. No one took this hand that she had stretched to
      all Europe. In vain she fired cannon in the Fronde; she remained to the
      end an adventuress, a state puppet, a weathercock, occasionally exiled,
      twenty times a widow, but always before the wedding, carrying over the
      whole of France the weariness and imaginations <span class="pagenum">[054]</span><a
      name="link054" id="link054"></a>of her involuntary celibacy. At last
      Lauzun appeared; to marry her, and secretly at that, cost him the half of
      his wealth; the king drew the dowry of his bastard from the misalliance of
      his cousin. It was an exemplary household: she scratched him: he beat her.&mdash;We
      laugh at these pretensions and bickerings, at these mischances and
      aristocratic quarrels; our turn will come, rest assured of that; our
      democracy too affords matter of laughter: our black coat is, like their
      embroidered coat, laced with the ridiculous; we have envy, melancholy, the
      want of moderation and of politeness, the heroes of George Sand, of Victor
      Hugo and of Balzac. In fact, what does it matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sifflez-moi librement; je vous le rends, mes frères.&rdquo; So
      talked Voltaire, who gave to all the world at once the charter of equality
      and gayety.

      passing, and I recall only two rows of white walls of staring brightness,
      into which low doorways here and there sank their black arches with a
      strange relief. An old and thoroughly forbidding cathedral bristled its
      bell-turrets and dentations in the midst of the pomp of nature and the
      joyousness of the light, as if the soil, burst open, had once put forth
      out of its lava a heap of crystallized sulphur.

      The postilion, a good fellow, takes up a poor woman on the way, and sets

      name="link058" id="link058"></a>in, then one of the people in the
      impériale. They laugh with their whole heart; their eyes sparkle. How far
      we are from the north! In all these southern folk there is <i>verve</i>;
      occasionally poverty, fatigue, anxiety crush it; at the least opening, it
      Gushes forth like living water in full sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      This poor woman amuses me. She is fifty years old, without shoes, garments
      in shreds, and not a sou in her pocket. She talks familiarly with a stout,
      well-dressed gentleman, who is behind her. No humility; she believes
      herself the equal of the whole world. Gayety is like a spring rendering
      the soul elastic; the people bend but rise again. An Englishman would be
      scandalized. Several of them have said to me that the French nation have
      no sentiment of respect. That is why we no longer have an aristocracy.

      The chain of the mountains undulates to the left, bluish and like a long
      stratum of clouds. The rich valley resembles a great basin full to
      overflowing of fruit-trees and maize. White clouds hover slowly in the
      depths of heaven, like a flock of tranquil swans. The eye rests on the
      down of their sides, and turns with pleasure upon the roundness of their
      noble forms. They sail in a troop, carried on by the south wind, with an
      even flight, like a family of blissful gods, and from up above they seem

      Orthez, in the fourteenth century, was a capital; of this grandeur there
      remains but the wreck: ruined walls and the high tower of the castle hung
      with ivy. The counts of Foix had there a little state, almost independent,
      proudly planted between the realms of France, England and Spain. The
      people have gained in something, I know; they no longer hate their
      neighbors, and they live at peace; they receive from Paris inventions and
      news; peace, trade and well-being are increased. They have, however, lost
      in something; instead of thirty active thinking capitals, there are thirty
      provincial cities, <span class="pagenum">[062]</span><a name="link062"

      The good Froissart came here in the year 1388, having ridden and chatted
      about arms all along the route with the chevalier Messire Espaing de Lyon;
      he lodged in the inn of the Beautiful Hostess, which was then called the
      hotel of the Moon. The count Gaston Phoebus sent in all haste to seek him:
      &ldquo;for he was the lord who of all the world the most gladly
      entertained the stranger in order to hear the news.&rdquo; Froissart
      passed twelve weeks in his hotel: &ldquo;for they made him good cheer and
      fed well his horses, and in all things also ordered well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Froissart is a child, and sometimes an old child. At that time thought was
      expanding, as in Greece <span class="pagenum">[063]</span><a name="link063"
      id="link063"></a>in the time of Herodotus. But, while we feel that in
      Greece it is going on to unfold itself to the very end, we discover here
      that an obstacle checks it: there is a knot in the tree; the arrested sap
      can mount no higher. This knot is scholasticism.

      For, during three centuries already they had written in verse, and for two
      centuries in prose; after this long culture, see what a historian is
      Froissart. One morning he mounts on horseback with several valets, under a
      beautiful sun, and gallops onward; <span class="pagenum">[064]</span><a
      name="link064" id="link064"></a>a lord meets him whom he accosts: &ldquo;Sir,
      what is this castle?&rdquo; The other tells him about the sieges, and what
      grand sword-thrusts were there exchanged. &ldquo;Holy Mary,&rdquo; cried
      Froissart, &ldquo;but your words please me and do me a deal of good, while
      you tell them off to me! And you shall not lose them, for all shall be set
      in remembrance and chronicled in the history which I am pursuing.&rdquo;
      Then he has explained to himself the kindred of the seigneur, his
      alliances, how his friends and enemies have lived and are dead, and the
      whole skein of the adventures interwoven during two centuries and in three
      countries. &ldquo;And as soon as I had alighted at the hotels, on the road
      that we were following together, I wrote them down, were it evening or
      morning, for the better memory of them in times to come; for there is no
      such exact retentive as writing.&rdquo; All is found here, the pell-mell
      and the hundred shifts of the conversations, the reflections, the little
      accidents of the journey. An old squire recounts to him mountain legends,
      how Pierre de Beam, having once killed an enormous bear, could no longer
      sleep in peace, but thenceforward he awaked each night, &ldquo;making such
      a noise and such clatter that it seemed that all the devils in hell should
      have carried away everything and were inside with him.&rdquo; Froissart
      judges that this bear was perhaps a knight turned <span class="pagenum">[065]</span><a
      name="link065" id="link065"></a>into a beast for some misdeed; cites in
      support the story of Actæon, an &ldquo;accomplished and pretty knight who
      was changed into a stag.&rdquo; Thus goes his life and thus his history is
      composed; it resembles a tapestry of the period, brilliant and varied,
      full of hunting, of tournaments, battles and processions. He gives himself
      and his hearers the pleasure of imagining ceremonies and adventures; no
      other idea, or rather no idea. Of criticism, general considerations,
      reasoning upon man or society, counsels or forecast, there is no trace; it
      is a herald at arms who seeks to please curious eyes, the warlike spirit
      and the empty minds of robust knights, great eaters, lovers of thumps and
      pomps. Is it not strange, this barrenness of reason! In Greece, at the end
      of an hundred years, Thucydides, Plato and Xenophon, philosophy and
      science had appeared. By way of climax, read the verses of Froissart,
      those ballads, roundelays and virelays that he recited of evenings to the
      Count de Foix, &ldquo;who took great solace in hearing them indeed,&rdquo;
      the old rubbish of decadence, worn, affected allegories, the garrulousness
      of a broken-down pedant who amuses himself in composing wearisome turns of
      address. And the rest are all alike. Charles d&rsquo;Orleans has a sort of
      faded grace and nothing-more, Christine de Pisan but an official
      solemnity.

      The cause is not far to seek; think of that stout cornific * doctor with
      leaden eyes, a confrère of Froissart, if you like, but how different! He
      holds in his hand his manual of canon-law, Peter the Lombard, a treatise
      on the syllogism. For ten hours a day he disputes in Baralipton on the <i>hicaeity</i>.

      As soon as he became hoarse, he dipped <span class="pagenum">[067]</span><a
      name="link067" id="link067"></a>his nose again into his yellow folio; his
      syllogisms and quiddities ended by making him stupid; he knew nothing
      about things or dared not consider them; he only wielded words, shook
      formulas together, bruised his own head, lost all common sense, and
      reasoned like a machine for Latin verses.* What a master for the sons of
      noblemen, and for keen poetic minds, and what an education was this
      labyrinth of dry logic and extravagant scholasticism. Tired, disgusted,
      irritated, stupefied, they forgot the ugly dream as soon as possible, ran
      in the open air, and thought only of the chase, of war and the ladies;
      they were not so foolish as to turn their eyes a second time towards their
      crabbed litany; if they did come back to it, that was out of vanity; they
      wanted to set some Latin fable in their songs, or some learned
      abstraction, without comprehending a word of it, donning it for fashion&rsquo;s
      sake, as the ermine of learning. With us of today, general ideas spring up
      in every mind,&mdash;living and flourishing ones; among the laity of that
      time their root was cut off, and among the clergy there remained of them
      but a fagot of dead wood. And so mankind was only the better fitted for
      the life of the body and more capable of violent passions; with regard to
      this the style of Froissart, <span class="pagenum">[068]</span><a
      name="link068" id="link068"></a>artless as it is, deceives us. We think we
      are listening to the pretty garrulousness of a child at play; beneath this
      prattle we must distinguish the rude voice of the combatants, bear-hunters
      and hunters of men too, and the broad, coarse hospitality of feudal
      manners.

      At midnight the Count of Foix came to supper in the great hall. &ldquo;Before
      him went twelve lighted torches, borne by twelve valets: and the same
      twelve torches were held before his table and gave much light unto the
      hall, which was full of knights and squires; and always there were plenty
      of tables laid out for any person who chose to sup.&rdquo; It must have
      been an <span class="pagenum">[069]</span><a name="link069" id="link069"></a>astonishing
      sight, to see those furrowed faces and powerful frames, with their furred
      robes and their justicoats streaked under the wavering flashes of the
      torches. One Christmas day, going into his gallery, he saw that there was
      but a small fire, and spoke of it aloud. Thereupon a knight, Ernauton d&rsquo;Espagne,
      having looked out of the window, saw in the court a number of asses with
      &ldquo;billets of wood for the use of the house. He seized the largest of
      these asses with his load, threw him over his shoulders and carried him up
      stairs&rdquo; (there were twenty-four steps), &ldquo;pushing through the
      crowd of knights and squires who were round the chimney, and flung ass and
      load, with his feet upward, on the dogs of the hearth, to the delight of
      the count, and the astonishment of all.&rdquo; Here are the laughter and
      the amusement of barbaric giants. They wanted noise, and songs
      proportioned to it. Froissart tells of a banquet when bishops, counts,
      abbés, knights, nearly one hundred in number, were seated at table.
      &ldquo;There were very many minstrels in the hall, as well those belonging
      to the count as to the strangers, who, at their leisure, played away their
      minstrelsy. Those of the duke de Touraine played so loud and so well that
      the count clothed them &lsquo;with cloth of gold trimmed with ermine.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This count,&rdquo; says Froissart, &ldquo;reigned prudently; <span
      class="pagenum">[070]</span><a name="link070" id="link070"></a>in all
      things he was so perfect that one could not praise him too much. No great
      contemporary prince could compare with him in sense, honor and wisdom.&rdquo;
      In that case the great princes of the day were not worth much. With
      justice and humanity, the good Froissart scarcely troubles himself; he
      finds murder perfectly natural; indeed, it was the custom; they were no
      more astonished at it, than at a snap of the jaws in a wolf. Man then
      resembled a beast of prey, and when a beast of prey has eaten up a sheep
      nobody is scandalized thereby. This excellent Count de Foix was an
      assassin, not once only, but ten times. For example, he coveted the castle
      of Lourdes, and so sent for the captain, Pierre Ernault, who had received
      it in trust for the prince of Wales. Pierre Ernault &ldquo;became very
      thoughtful and doubtful whether to go or not.&rdquo; At last he went, and
      the count demanded from him the castle of Lourdes. The knight thought
      awhile what answer to make. However, having well considered, he said:
      &ldquo;My lord, in truth I owe you faith and homage, for I am a poor
      knight of your blood and country; but as for the castle of Lourdes, I will
      never surrender it to you. You have sent for me, and you may therefore do
      with me as you please. I hold the castle of Lourdes from the king of
      England, who has placed me there; and to no other person but <span
      class="pagenum">[071]</span><a name="link071" id="link071"></a>to him will
      I ever surrender it.&rdquo; The Count de Foix, on hearing this answer, was
      exceedingly wroth, and said, as he drew his dagger, &ldquo;Ho, ho, dost
      thou then say so? By this head, thou hast not said it for nothing.&rdquo;
      And, as he uttered these words, he struck him foully with the dagger, so
      that he wounded him severely in five places, and none of the barons or
      knights dared to interfere.

      The knight replied, &ldquo;Ha, ha, my lord, this is not gentle treatment;
      you sent for me here, and are murdering me.&rdquo; Having received these
      five strokes from the dagger, the count ordered him to be cast into the
      dungeon, which was done; and there he died, for he was ill-cured of his
      wounds. This dominance of sudden passion, this violence <span
      class="pagenum">[072]</span><a name="link072" id="link072"></a>of first
      impulse, this flesh and blood emotion, and abrupt appeal to physical

      As we were leaving Dax, a diligence passed ours, grazing one of the
      horses. The conductor leaped down from his seat, a stake in his hand, and
      was going to fell his <i>confrèr</i>. Those lords lived and felt something
      like our conductors, and the Count de Foix was such an one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg pardon of the conductors; I wrong them grievously. The count, not
      having the fear of the police before his eyes, came at once not to
      fisticuffs, but to stabs. His son Gaston, while on a visit to the king of
      Navarre, received a black powder which, according to the king, must
      forever reconcile <span class="pagenum">[073]</span><a name="link073"
      id="link073"></a>the count and his wife; the youth took the powder in a
      little bag and concealed it in his breast; one day his bastard brother,
      Yvain, saw the bag while playing with him, wanted to have it, and
      afterward denounced him to the count. At this the count &ldquo;began to
      have suspicions, for he was full of fancies,&rdquo; and remained so until
      dinner-time, very thoughtful, haunted and harassed by sombre imaginings.
      Those stormy brains, filled by warfare and danger with dismal images,
      hastened to tumult and tempest. The youth came, and began to serve the
      dishes, tasting the meats, as was usual when the notion of poison was not
      far from any mind. The count cast his eyes upon him and saw the strings of
      the bag; the sight fired his veins and made his blood boil; he seized the
      youth, undid his pourpoint, cut the strings of the bag, and strewed some
      of the powder over a slice of bread, while the poor youth turned pale with
      fear, and began to tremble exceedingly. Then he called one of his dogs to
      him, and gave it him to eat. &ldquo;The instant the dog had eaten a morsel
      his eyes rolled round in his head, and he died.&rdquo; The count said
      nothing, but rose suddenly, and seizing his knife, threw himself upon his
      son. But the knights rushed in between them: &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,
      my lord, do not be too hasty, but make further inquiries before you do any
      ill to your son.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[074]</span><a name="link074"

    </h4>
    <p>
      The count heaped malediction and insult upon the youth, then suddenly
      leaped over the table, knife in hand, and fell upon him like a wild beast.
      But the knights and the squires fell upon their knees before him weeping,
      and saying: &ldquo;Ah, ah! my lord, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake do not kill
      Gaston; you have no other child.&rdquo; With great difficulty he
      restrained himself, doubtless thinking that it was prudent to see if no
      one else had a part in the matter, and put the youth into the tower at
      Orthez.
    </p>
    <p>
      He investigated then, but in a singular fashion, as if he were a famished
      wolf, wedded to a single idea, bruising himself against it mechanically
      and brutally, through murder and outcry, killing blindly and without
      reflecting that his killing is of no use to him. He had many of those who
      served his <span class="pagenum">[075]</span><a name="link075" id="link075"></a>son
      arrested, and &ldquo;put to death not less than fifteen after they had
      suffered the torture; and the reason he gave was, that it was impossible
      but they must have been acquainted with the secrets of his son, and they
      ought to have informed him by saying, &lsquo;My lord, Gaston wears
      constantly on his breast a bag of such and such a form.&rsquo; This they
      did not do and suffered a terrible death for it; which was a pity, for
      there were not in all Gascony such handsome or well-appointed squires.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When this search had proved useless he fell back upon his son; he sent for
      the nobles, the prelates and all the principal persons of his country,
      related the affair to them, and told them that it was his intention to put
      the youth to death. But they would not agree to this, and said that the
      country had need of an heir for its better preservation and defence;
      &ldquo;and would not quit Orthez until the count had assured them that
      Gaston should not be put to death, so great was their affection for him.&rdquo;
      Still the youth remained in the tower of Orthez, &ldquo;where was little
      light,&rdquo; always lying alone, unwilling to eat, &ldquo;cursing the
      hour that ever he was born or begotten, that he should come to such an
      end.&rdquo; On the tenth day the jailer saw all the meats that had been
      served in a corner, and went and told it to the count. The count was again
      enraged, like a beast of prey who encounters a <span class="pagenum">[076]</span><a
      name="link076" id="link076"></a>remnant of resistance after it has once
      been satiated; &ldquo;without saying a word,&rdquo; he came to the prison,
      holding by the point a small knife with which he was cleaning his nails.
      Then striking his fist upon his son&rsquo;s throat, he pushed him rudely
      as he said: &ldquo;Ha, traitor, why dost thou not eat?&rdquo; and went
      away without saying more. His knife had touched an artery; the youth
      frightened and wan, turned without a word to the other side of the bed,
      shed his blood and died.

      The count was grieved beyond measure when he heard this, for those violent
      natures felt only with excess and by contrasts; he had himself shaven and
      clothed in black. &ldquo;The body of the youth was borne, with tears and
      lamentations, to the church of the Augustine Friars at Orthez, where it
      was buried.&rdquo; * But such murders left an ill-healed <span
      class="pagenum">[077]</span><a name="link077" id="link077"></a>wound in
      the heart; the dull pain remained, and from time to time some dark shadow
      crossed the tumult of the banquets. This is why the count never again felt
      such perfect joy as before.

      It was a sad time; there is hardly another in which one would have lived
      so unwillingly. Poetry was imbecile, chivalry was falling into brigandage,
      religion suffered degradation, the State, disjointed, was crumbling away;
      the nation, ground down by king, by nobles and by Englishmen, struggled
      for <span class="pagenum">[078]</span><a name="link078" id="link078"></a>a
      hundred years in a slough, between the dying middle-age and the modern era
      which was not yet opened. And yet a man like Ernauton must have
      experienced a unique and splendid joy when, planted like a Hercules upon
      his two feet, feeling his shirt of mail upon his breast, he pierced
      through a hedge of pikes, and wielded his great sword in the sunlight.

      Nothing can be pleasanter than to journey alone in an unknown country,
      without a definite end, without recent cares; all little thoughts are
      blotted out. Do I know whether this field belongs to Peter or to Paul;
      whether the engineer is at war with the prefect, or if there is any
      dispute over a projected canal or road? I am happy indeed in know-all
      that; happier still in first time, finding fresh <span class="pagenum">[080]</span><a
      name="link080" id="link080"></a>sensations, and not being troubled by
      comparisons and souvenirs. I can consider things through-general views, no
      longer regarding the soil as made the most of by mankind, can forget the
      useful, think only of the beautiful, and feel the movement of forms and
      the expression of colors.

      The very road seems beautiful to me. What an air of resignation in those
      old elms. They bud and spread forth in branches, from head to foot, they
      have such a desire for life, even under this dust. Then come lustrous
      plane trees, tossing their beautiful and regular leaves. White bindweed,
      blue campanulas, hang at the edge of the ditches. Is it not strange that
      these pretty creatures remain so solitary, that they should be fated to
      die to-morrow, that they should scarcely have looked upon us an instant;
      that their beauty should have flourished only for its two seconds of
      admiration? They too have their world, this people of high grasses bending
      over on themselves; these lizards which wave the thicket of the herbs;
      these gilded wasps that hum in their chalices. This world here is well
      worth ours, and I find them happy in opening thus, then in closing their
      pale eyes to the peaceful whisper of the wind.

      These slopes and roundnesses are as expressive as human forms; but how
      much more varied, how much stranger and richer in attitudes? Those there
      on the horizon, almost hid behind a troop of others, smile dimly in their
      timidness, under their crown of vapory gauze; they form a round on the
      brink of heaven, a fleeting round that the least disturbance of the air
      would put out of sight, and which yet regards with tenderness the fretted
      creatures lost in its bosom. Others, their neighbors, rudely dint the soil
      with their haunches and their brown slopes; the human structure here half
      peeps forth, then disappears under the mineral barbarism; here are the
      children of another age, ever powerful, severe still, unknown and antique
      races, whose mysterious history the mind searches without willing it.
      Tawny moors filled with herds mount upon their flanks to the summits;
      splendid meadows sparkle upon their back. Some among these plunge abruptly
      away down into depths where they disgorge the streams that they
      accumulate, and where is gathered all the heat of the burning vault which
      shines above under the most generous sun. It, meanwhile, embraces and
      broods over the country; from woods, plains, hills, the great soul of
      <span class="pagenum">[084]</span><a name="link084" id="link084"></a>vegetation
      starts forth mounting to meet its rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here your neighbor, who is engaged in a warm dispute, pulls your sleeve,
      crying: &ldquo;The gigot at Orthez doesn&rsquo;t give cramps in the
      stomach, does it, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      You start; then in another moment you turn your nose toward the window.
      But the sensation has disappeared: the mutton of Dax has blotted out
      everything. The meadows are so many kilogrammes of unmown hay, the trees
      are so many feet of timber, and the herds are only walking beefsteaks.

    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>au is a pretty
      city, neat, of gay appearance; but the highway is paved with little round
      stones, the side-walks with small sharp pebbles: so the horses walk on the
      heads of nails and foot-passengers on the points of them. From Bordeaux to
      Toulouse such is the usage, such the pavement. At the end of five minutes,
      your feet tell you in the most intelligible manner that you are two
      hundred leagues away from Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      You meet wagons loaded with wood, of rustic <span class="pagenum">[086]</span><a
      name="link086" id="link086"></a>simplicity, the invention of which goes
      back to the time of Vercingetorix, but the only thing capable of climbing
      and descending the stony escarpments of the mountains. They are composed
      of the trunk of a tree placed across the axles and sustaining two oblique
      hurdles; they are drawn by two great whitish oxen, decked with a piece of
      hanging cloth, a net of thread upon the head and crowned with ferns, all
      to shield them from the gray flies. This suggests food for thought; for
      the skin of man is far more tender than that of the ox, and the gray flies
      have sworn no peace with our kind. Before the oxen ordinarily marches a
      peasant, of a distrustful and cunning air, armed with a long switch, and
      dressed in white woollen vest and brown breeches; behind the wagon comes a
      little bare-footed boy, very wide awake and very ragged, whose old velvet
      cap falls like the head of a wrinkled mushroom, and who stops struck with
      admiration at the magnificent aspect of the diligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those are the true countrymen of Henry IV. As to the pretty ladies in
      gauzy hats, whose swelling and rustling robes graze the horns of the
      motionless oxen as they pass, you must not look at them; they would carry
      your imagination back to the Boulevard de Gand, and you would have gone
      two hundred leagues only to remain in the same place. I am here on purpose
      to visit the sixteenth <span class="pagenum">[087]</span><a name="link087"
      id="link087"></a>century; one makes a journey for the sake of changing,
      not place, but ideas. Point out to a Parisian the gate by which Henry IV.
      entered Paris; he will have great difficulty in calling up the armor, the
      halberts and the whole victorious and tumultuous procession that l&rsquo;Etoile
      describes: it is because he passed by there to-day on such and such
      business, that yesterday he met there a friend, while last year he looked
      upon this gate in the midst of a public festival.

      All these thoughts hurry along with the force of habit, repelling and
      stifling the historic spectacle which was going to lift itself into full
      light and unroll itself before the mind. Set down the same man in Pau:
      there he knows neither hotels, nor people, nor shops; his imagination, out
      of its element, may run at random; no known object will trip him up and
      make him fall into the cares of interest, the passion of to-day; he enters
      into the past as a matter of course, and walks there as if at home, at his
      ease. It was eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning; not a visitor at the
      castle, no one in the courts nor on the terrace; I should not have been
      too much astonished at meeting the Béarnais, &ldquo;that lusty gallant,
      that very devil,&rdquo; who <span class="pagenum">[088]</span><a
      name="link088" id="link088"></a>was sharp enough to get for himself the
      name of &ldquo;the good king.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His chateau is very irregular; it is only when seen from the valley that
      any grace and harmony can be found in it. Above two rows of pointed roofs
      and old houses, it stands out alone against the sky and gazes upon the
      valley in the distance; two bell-turrets project from the front toward the
      west; the oblong body follows, and two massive brick towers close the line
      with their esplanades and battlements. It is connected with the city by a
      narrow old bridge, by a broad modern one with the park, and the foot of
      its terrace is bathed by a dark but lovely stream. Near at hand, this
      arrangement disappears; a fifth tower upon the north side deranges the
      symmetry.

      The great egg-shaped court is a mosaic of incongruous masonry; above the
      porch, a wall of pebbles from the Gave, and of red bricks crossed like a
      tapestry design; opposite, fixed to the wall, a row of medallions in
      stone; upon the sides, doors of every form and age; dormer windows,
      windows square, pointed, embattled, with stone mullions garlanded with
      elaborate reliefs. This masquerade of styles troubles the mind, yet not
      unpleasantly; it is unpretending and artless; each century has built
      according to its own fancy, without concerning itself about its neighbor.

      On the first floor is shown a great tortoise-shell, which was the cradle
      of Henry IV. Carved chests, dressing-tables, tapestries, clocks of that
      day, the bed and arm-chair of Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, a complete set of
      furniture in the taste of the Renaissance striking and sombre, painfully
      labored yet magnificent in style, carrying the mind at once back toward
      that age of force and effort, of boldness in invention, of unbridled
      pleasures and terrible toil, of sensuality and of heroism. Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret,
      mother of Henry IV., crossed France in order that she might, according to
      her promise, be confined in this castle. &ldquo;A princess,&rdquo; says d&rsquo;Aubigné,
      &ldquo;having nothing of the woman about her but the sex, a soul entirely
      given to manly things, a mind mighty in great affairs, a heart

      She sang an old Bearnese song when she brought him into the world. They
      say that the aged grandfather rubbed the lips of the new-born child with a
      clove of garlic, poured into his mouth a few drops of Jurançon wine, and
      carried him away in his dressing-gown.

      The child was born in the chamber which opens into the tower of Mazères,
      on the south-west corner. &ldquo;His grandfather took him away from his
      father and mother, and would have this child brought up at his door,
      reproaching his daughter and his son-in-law with having lost several of
      their children through French luxuries. And, indeed, he brought him up in
      the Bearnese manner, that is, bareheaded and barefoot, often with no <span
      class="pagenum">[093]</span><a name="link093" id="link093"></a>more nicety
      than is shown in the bringing up of children among the peasantry. This odd
      resolution was successful, and formed a body in which heat and cold,
      unmeasured toil and all sorts of troubles were unable to produce any
      change, thus apportioning his nourishment to his condition, as though God
      wished at that time to prepare a sure remedy and a firm heart of steel
      against the iron knots of our dire calamities.&rdquo;

      His mother, a warm and severe Calvinist, when he was fifteen years old,
      led him through the Catholic army to la Rochelle, and gave him to her
      followers as their general. At sixteen years old, at the combat of
      Arnay-le-Duc, he led the first charge of cavalry. What an education and
      what men! Their descendants were just now passing in the streets, going to
      school to compose Latin verses and recite the pastorals of Massillon.

    <p>
      Those old wars are the most poetic in French history; they were made for
      pleasure rather than interest. It was a chase in which adventures,
      dangers, emotions were found, in which men lived in the sunlight, on
      horseback, amidst flashes of fire, and where the body, as well as the
      soul, had its <span class="pagenum">[094]</span><a name="link094"
      id="link094"></a>enjoyment and its exercise. Henry carries it on as
      briskly as a dance, with a Gascon&rsquo;s fire and a soldier&rsquo;s
      ardor, with abrupt sallies, and pursuing his point against the enemy as
      with the ladies. This is no spectacle of great masses of well-disciplined
      men, coming heavily into collision and falling by thousands on the field,
      according to the rules of good tactics. The king leaves Pau or Nérac with
      a little troop, picks up the neighboring garrisons on his way, scales a
      fortress, intercepts a body of arquebusiers as they pass, extricates
      himself pistol in hand from the midst of a hostile troop, and returns to
      the feet of Mlle. de Tignonville.

      They arrange their plan from day to day; nothing is done unless
      unexpectedly and by chance. Enterprises are strokes of fortune. Here is
      one which Sully had recounted by his secretary; I like to listen to old
      words among old monuments, and to feel the mutual fitness of objects and
      of style: <span class="pagenum">[095]</span><a name="link095" id="link095"></a>"The
      king of Navarre formed the design of seizing on the city of Eause, which,
      by good right, was his, and where he had chance of fine fortune; for
      deeming that the inhabitants, who had not been willing to receive a
      garrison, should have respect for his person, who was their lord, he
      determined to march all day long in order to enter in with few people, so
      as to create no alarm, and, indeed, having taken only fifteen or sixteen
      of you, gentlemen, who placed yourselves nearest to him, among whom were
      you, with simple cuirasses under your hunting tunics, two swords and two
      pistols, he surprised the gate of the city and entered in before they of
      the guard were able to take up arms. But one of these gave the alarm to
      him who was sentinel at the portal, and he cut the cord in the slide of
      the portcullis, so that it fell immediately almost on the croup of your
      horse and that of your cousin, M. de Béthune the elder, and hindered the
      troop which was coming up on the gallop from entering, so that the king
      and you fifteen or sixteen alone remained shut up in this city, where all
      the people, being armed, fell upon you in divers troops and at divers
      times, while the tocsin rang furiously, and a cry of &lsquo;<i>Arm, arm!&rsquo;
      and 'Kill, Kill!</i> resounded on all sides,&mdash;seeing which, the king
      of Navarre, from the first troop which came up, some fifty strong, in part
      well, in part ill armed, <span class="pagenum">[096]</span><a
      name="link096" id="link096"></a>he, I say, marching, pistol in hand,
      straight at them, called out to you: &lsquo;Come now, my friends, my
      comrades; it is here that you must show courage and resolution, for
      thereon depends our safety; let each one then follow me and do as I do,
      and not fire until the pistol touches.&rsquo; At the same time, hearing
      three or four cry out: 'Fire at that scarlet tunic, at that white plume,
      for it is the king of Navarre,&rsquo; he charged on them so impetuously
      that, without firing more than five or six times, they took fright and
      withdrew in several troops. Others in like manner came against you three
      or four times; but as soon as they saw that they were broken, they fired a
      few times and turned away until, having rallied nearly two hundred
      together, they forced you to gain a doorway, and two of you went up to
      give a signal to the rest of the troop that the king was there, and that
      the gate must be burst open, as the draw-bridge had not been raised.
      Whereupon each one began working, and then several among that populace who
      loved the king, and others who feared to offend him, began raising a
      tumult in his favor; finally, after a few arquebusades and pistol-shots
      from both sides, there arose such dissension among them, some crying,
      &lsquo;We must yield;&rsquo; others, &lsquo;We must defend ourselves;&rsquo;
      that the irresolution afforded means and time for opening the gates, and
      for all the troops to present <span class="pagenum">[097]</span><a
      name="link097" id="link097"></a><br /> <span class="pagenum">[098]</span><a
      name="link098" id="link098"></a>themselves, at the head of whom the king
      placed himself, and saw most of the peoples fleeing and the consuls with
      their chaperons crying: &lsquo;Sire, we are your subjects and your
      peculiar servants. Alas! allow not the sacking of this city, which is
      yours, on account of the madness of a few worthless fellows, who should be
      driven out. He placed himself, I said, at the head to prevent pillage:
      thus there was committed neither violence, nor disorder, nor any other
      punishment, except that four, who had fired at the white plume, were hung,
      to the joy of all the other inhabitants, who thought not that they should
      be quiet on such ood terms."<span class="pagenum">[099]</span><a

      At Cahors he burst in the two gates with petard and axe, and fought five
      days and five nights in the city, carrying house after house. Are not
      these chivalric adventures and poetry in action? &ldquo;So, so, cavaliers,&rdquo;
      cried the Catholics at Marmande; &ldquo;a pistol-shot for love of the
      mistress; for your court is too full of lovely ladies to know any lack of
      them.&rdquo; Henry escaped like a true paladin, and lost his victory at
      Contras in order to carry to the beautiful Corisandre the flags that he
      had taken. To act, to dare, to enjoy, to expend force and trouble like a
      prodigal, to be given up to the present sensation, be forever urged by
      passions forever lively, support and <span class="pagenum">[100]</span><a

      &ldquo;We came together,&rdquo; says Marguerite, &ldquo;to take walks in
      company, either in a lovely garden where are long alleys of cypress and
      laurel, or in the park which I had caused to be made, in alleys three
      thousand paces long, which border the river; and the rest of the day was
      spent in all sorts of suitable pleasures, a ball ordinarily filling the
      afternoon and the evening.&rdquo; The grave Sully &ldquo;took <span
      class="pagenum">[101]</span><a name="link101" id="link101"></a>a mistress
      like the rest.&rdquo; In visiting the restored dining-hall, you repeople
      it involuntarily with the sumptuous costumes described by Brantôme: ladies
      &ldquo;clad in orange-color and gold lace, robes of cloth of silver, of
      crisped cloth of gold, stuffs perfectly stiff with ornaments and
      embroidery. Queen Marguerite in a robe of flesh-colored Spanish velvet,
      heavily loaded with gold lace, so decked out with plumes and precious
      stones as nothing ever was before.&rdquo; I said to M. de Ronsard: &ldquo;Do
      you not seem to see this beautiful queen, in such guise, appearing as the
      lovely Aurora, when she is going to spring up before the day, with her
      beautiful pale face, bordered with its ruby and carnation color?&rdquo; At
      the ball in the evening, she loved to dance &ldquo;the <i>pavane</i> of
      Spain and the Italian <i>pazzemano.</i> The passages in this were so well
      danced, the steps so judiciously conducted, the rests so beautifully made,
      that you knew not which most to admire, the beautiful manner of dancing,
      or the majesty of the steps, representing now gayety, now a fine and grave

      intrigues, quarrels and <span class="pagenum">[102]</span><a name="link102"
      id="link102"></a>conjugal comedies, one of which is very prettily and very
      artlessly told by the queen; Mlle. de Fosseuse was the heroine. &ldquo;The
      pain seized her one morning, at the break of day, while in bed in the
      chamber of the maids, and she sent for my physician and begged him to go
      and inform the king my husband, which he did. We were in bed in the same
      chamber, but in separate beds, according to our custom. When the physician
      gave him this bit of news, he was in great trouble, not knowing what to
      do, fearful on the one hand lest she should be discovered, and on the
      other lest she should want help, for he loved her dearly. He determined,
      finally, to confess all to me, and to beg me go to her assistance, for he
      knew well that, whatever might have passed, he should always find me ready
      to serve him in anything that could please him. He opens my curtain and
      says to me: &lsquo;Dearest, I have concealed from you one thing which I
      must confess to you: I beg you to excuse me for it, and not to remember
      all that I have said to you on this subject. But oblige me so much as to
      get up at once, and go to the assistance of Fosseuse, who is very ill; I
      am sure that you would not wish, when you see her in that condition, to
      resent what is past. You know how much I love her; I beg that you will
      oblige me in this matter.&rsquo; I <span class="pagenum">[103]</span><a
      name="link103" id="link103"></a>told him that I honored him too much to be
      offended with anything coming from him. That I would be off and do as if
      it were my daughter; that in the mean time he should go to the chase and
      take everybody with him, so that no talk of it should be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had her promptly removed from the chamber of the maids and put
      into a chamber apart, with my physician and women to wait upon her, and
      gave her my best assistance. God willed that it should be only a daughter,
      which moreover was dead. After the delivery, she was carried to the
      chamber of the maids, where, though all possible discretion was used, they
      could not prevent the report from spreading throughout the castle. When
      the king my husband was returned from the chase, he went to see her
      according to his custom; she begged him that I would come to see her, as I
      was accustomed to visit all my maids when they were ill, thinking to stop
      by this means the spread of the report. The king my husband came into the
      chamber and found that I had gone to bed again, for I was tired with
      getting up so early, and with the trouble I had had in rendering her
      assistance. He begged that I would get up and go to see her; I told him
      that I had done so when she had need of my aid, but now she no longer had
      occasion for it; that if I went there, I should reveal rather than <span
      class="pagenum">[104]</span><a name="link104" id="link104"></a>cloak the
      truth, and that everybody would point their finger at me. He was seriously
      vexed with me, and this was far from pleasant to me, for it seemed that I
      had not deserved such a recompense for what I had done in the morning. She
      often put him into similar mood toward me.&rdquo;

      Compassionate souls, who admire the complaisance of the queen, do not pity
      her too much: she punished the king, by imitating him, at Usson and
      elsewhere.

      And yet Pan was a lesser Geneva. Amidst these violences and this
      voluptuousness, devotion <span class="pagenum">[105]</span><a
      name="link105" id="link105"></a>was warm; they went to sermons or to the
      church, with the same air as to the battle-field or the rendezvous. This
      is because religion then was not a virtue, but a passion. In such case,
      the neighboring passions, instead of extinguishing it, only inflame; the
      heart overflows on that side as on the others. When the lazzarone has
      stabbed his enemy, he finds a second pleasure, says Beyle, in prating
      about his anger, alongside a wire grating in a great box of black wood.
      The Hindoo that gets excited and howls at the feast of Juggernaut, to the
      hubbub of fifty thousand tom-toms, the American Methodist who weeps and
      cries aloud his sins in a revival, feels something the same sort of
      pleasure as an Italian enthusiast at the opera. That explains and
      reconciles the zeal and the gallantry of Marguerite.

      &ldquo;They only allowed me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to have mass said in
      a little chapel not more than three or four paces long, which, narrow as
      it was, was full when there were seven or eight of us there. So when they
      wanted to say mass, they raised the bridge of the castle, for fear that
      the Catholics of the country, who had no exercise of their religion,
      should hear of it; for they had an infinite desire to assist at the holy
      sacrifice, of which they had been deprived for several years. And, urged
      by this sacred desire, the inhabitants of Pau found <span class="pagenum">[106]</span><a
      name="link106" id="link106"></a>means, at Whitsuntide, before the bridge
      was raised, to enter the castle, and slip into the chapel, where they were
      not discovered until toward the end of mass, when, half opening the door
      to let in one of my people, some Huguenots who were spying round the door
      perceived them, and went to tell it to le Pin, secretary of the king my
      husband, and he sent there some guards of the king my husband, who,
      dragging them forth and beating them in my presence, carried them off to
      prison, where they remained a long time, and paid a heavy fine.&rdquo;

      The little chapel has disappeared, I believe, since the castle and the
      whole country were <span class="pagenum">[107]</span><a name="link107"
      id="link107"></a>restored to the Catholic worship. Besides, this treatment
      arose from humanity: Saint-Pont, at Macon, &ldquo;afforded the ladies, as
      they went out from the banquets that he gave, the pleasure of seeing a
      certain number of prisoners leap off from the bridge.&rdquo; Such were
      these men, extreme in everything, in fanaticism, in pleasure, in violence;
      never did the fountain of desires flow fuller and deeper; never did more
      vigorous passions unfold themselves with more of sap and greenness.
      Walking through these silent halls, disturbed from time to time by fair
      invalids or pale young consumptives who walk there, I fancied that
      enervation of the inner nature came from the enervation of the bodies. We
      spend our time within doors, taken up with discussions, reflections and
      reading; the gentleness of manners removes dangers from us, and industrial
      progress fatigues. They lived in the open air, ever following the chase
      and in war. &ldquo;Queen Catherine was very fond of riding, up to the age
      of sixty and more, and of making great and active journeys, even after she
      had often fallen, to the great injury of her body, for she was several
      times so far hurt as to break her leg and wound her head.&rdquo; The rude
      exercises hardened their nerves; their warmer blood, stirred by incessant
      peril, urged upon the brain impetuous caprices; they made history, while
      we write it. <span class="pagenum">[108]</span><a name="link108"

      The park is a great wood on a hill, embedded among meadows and harvests.
      You walk in long solitary alleys, under colonnades of superb oaks, while
      to the left the lofty stems of the copses mount in close ranks upon the
      back of the hill. The fog was not yet lifted; there was no motion in the
      air; not a corner of blue sky, not a sound in all the country. The song of
      a bird came for an instant from the midst of the ash-trees, then sadly
      ceased. Is that then the sky of the south, and was it necessary to come to
      the happy country of the Béarnais to find such <span class="pagenum">[109]</span><a
      name="link109" id="link109"></a>melancholy impressions? A little by-way
      brought us to a bank of the Gave: in a long pool of water was growing an
      army of reeds twice the height of a man; their grayish spikes and their
      trembling leaves bent and whispered under the wind; a wild flower near by
      shed a vanilla perfume. We gazed on the broad country, the ranges of
      rounded hills, the silent plain under the dull dome of the sky. Three
      hundred paces away the Gave rolls between marshalled banks, which it has
      covered with sand; in the midst of the waters may be seen the moss-grown
      piles of a ruined bridge. One is at ease here, and yet at the bottom of
      the heart one feels a vague unrest; the soul is softened and loses itself
      in melancholy and tender revery. Suddenly the clock strikes, and one has
      to go and prepare to take his soup between two commercial travellers.

      To-day the sun shines. On my way to the <i>Place Nationale</i>, I remarked
      a poor, half-ruined church, which had been turned into a coachhouse; they
      have fastened upon it a carrier&rsquo;s sign. The arcades, in small gray
      stones, still round themselves with an elegant boldness; beneath are
      stowed away carts and casks and pieces of wood; here and there workmen
      were handling wheels. A broad ray of light fell upon a pile of straw, and
      made the sombre corners seem yet darker; the pictures that one meets with
      outweigh those one has come to seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the esplanade which is opposite, the whole valley and the mountains
      beyond may be seen; this first sight of a southern sun, as it breaks from
      the rainy mists, is admirable; a sheet of white light stretches from one
      horizon to another without meeting a single cloud. The heart expands in
      this immense space; the very air is festal; the dazzled eyes close beneath
      the brightness which deluges them and which runs over, radiated from the
      burning dome of heaven. The current of the river sparkles like a girdle of
      jewels; the chains of hills, yesterday veiled and damp, extend at their
      own sweet will beneath the warming, penetrating rays, and mount range upon
      range to spread out their <span class="pagenum">[111]</span><a
      name="link111" id="link111"></a>green robe to the sun. In the distance,
      the blue Pyrenees look like a bank of clouds; the air that bathes them
      shapes them into aerial forms, vapory phantoms, the farthest of which
      vanish in the canescent horizon&mdash;dim contours, that might be taken
      for a fugitive sketch from the lightest of pencils.

      In the midst of the serrate chain the peak du <i>Midi d&rsquo; Ossau</i>
      lifts its abrupt cone; at this distance, forms are softened, colors are
      blended, the Pyrenees are only the graceful bordering of a smiling
      landscape and of the magnificent sky. There is nothing imposing about them
      nor severe; the beauty here is serene, and the pleasure pure. <span

      The statue of Henry IV., with an inscription in Latin and in patois, is on
      the esplanade; the armor is finished so perfectly that it might make an
      armorer jealous. But why does the king wear so sad an air? His neck is ill
      at ease on his shoulders; his features are small and full of care; he has
      lost his gayety, his spirit, his confidence in his fortune, his proud
      bearing. His air is neither that of a great nor a good man, nor of a man
      of intellect; his face is discontented, and one would say that he was
      bored with Pau. I am not sure that he was wrong: and yet the city passes
      for agreeable; the climate is very mild, and invalids who fear the cold
      pass the winter in it. Balls are given in the clubs; the English abound,
      and it is well known that in the matter of cookery, of beds and inns,
      these people are the first reformers in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would have done well in reforming the vehicles: the rickety little
      diligences of the country are drawn by gaunt jades which descend the hills
      on a walk, and make stops in the ascent. All encouragements of the whip
      are thrown away on their backs; you could not bear them any grudge on that
      account, so piteous is their appearance, with their ridgy backbones,
      hanging ears, and shrunken bellies. The coachman rises on his <span
      class="pagenum">[113]</span><a name="link113" id="link113"></a>seat, pulls
      the reins, waves his arms, bawls and storms, clambers down and up again;
      his is a rude calling, but he has a soul like his calling. His passengers
      are of small consequence to him; he treats them as useful packages, a
      necessary counterpoise over which he has rights. At the foot of a
      mountain, the machine got its wheel into a ditch and tilted over; every
      one leaped out after the manner of Panurge&rsquo;s sheep.

      however remained cool, and went on afoot, while he followed grumbling and

      A warmer sun makes the vigorous verdure shine more richly; the stalks of
      maize spring from the earth like discharges of rockets, and their strong,

      Toward Gan, the hills, over which undulates the road, draw nearer
      together, and you travel on through little green valleys, planted with ash
      and alder in clusters, according to the caprices of the slopes, and with
      their feet bathed in living water; a pellucid stream borders the road,
      with waters <span class="pagenum">[115]</span><a name="link115"

      then, by fits and starts, brilliant and blue as the sky. Four times in the
      course of a league it encounters a mill, leaps and foams, then resumes its
      course, hurried and stealthy; during two leagues we have its company, half
      hid among the trees that it nourishes, and breathing the freshness it
      exhales. In these gorges, water is the mother of all life and the nurse of

      At Louvie the valley of Ossau opens up between two mountains covered with
      brushwood, bald in places, spotted with moss and heather from which the
      rocks peep out like bones, while the flanks start forth in grayish
      embossments or bend in dark crevices. The plain of the harvests and
      meadows buries itself in the anfractuosities as if in creeks; its contour
      folds itself about each new mass; it essays to scale the lower ridges, and
      stops, vanquished by the barren rock. We go through three or four hamlets
      whitened by dust, whose roofs shine <span class="pagenum">[116]</span><a
      name="link116" id="link116"></a>with a dull color like tarnished lead.
      Then the horizon is shut off; Mount Gourzy, robed in forests, bars the
      route; beyond and above, like a second barrier, the peak of the Ger lifts
      its bald head, silvered with snows. The carriage slowly scales an
      acclivity which winds upon the flank of the mountain; at the turn of a
      rock, in the shelter of a small gorge, may be seen Eaux Bonnes.

      This singular village tries every year to extend itself, and with great
      difficulty, so straitened and stifled is it in its ravine; they break the
      rock, they open trenches on the declivity, they suspend houses over the
      torrent, they stick others, as it were, to the side of the mountain, they
      pile up their chimneys even to the roots of the beech-trees; thus they
      construct behind the principal street a melancholy lane <span
      class="pagenum">[119]</span><a name="link119" id="link119"></a>which dips
      down or raises itself as it can, muddy, steep, half filled with temporary
      stalls and wooden wine-shops, lodging-places of artisans and guides; at
      last it drops down to the Gave, into a nook decked out with drying linen,
      which is washed in the same place with the hogs.

      Of all places in the world, Eaux Bonnes is the most unpleasant on a rainy
      day, and rainy days are frequent there; the clouds are engulfed between
      two walls of the valley of Ossau, and crawl slowly <span class="pagenum">[120]</span><a
      name="link120" id="link120"></a>along half way up the height; the summits
      disappear, the floating masses come together, accumulate because the gorge
      has no outlet, and fall in fine cold rain. The village becomes a prison;
      the fog creeps to the earth, envelopes the houses, extinguishes the light
      already obscured by the mountain; the English might think themselves in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors look through the window-panes at the jumbled forms of the
      trees, the water that drips from the leaves, the mourning of the shivering
      and humid woods; they listen to the gallop of belated riders, who return
      with clinging and pendent skirts, like fine birds with their plumage
      disordered by the rain; they try whist in their despondency; some go down
      to the reading-room and ask for the most blood-stained pages of Paul Féval
      or Frédéric Souliê; they can read nothing but the gloomiest dramas; they
      discover leanings towards suicide in themselves, and construct the theory
      of assassination. They look at the clock and bethink themselves that the
      doctor has ordered them to drink three times a day; then they button up
      their overcoats with an air of resignation, and climb the long, stiff
      slope of the streaming road; the lines of umbrellas and soaked mantles are
      a pitiable spectacle; they come, splashing through the water, and seat
      themselves in the drinking-hall. Each one takes his syrup-flask from its
      numbered place on a sort <span class="pagenum">[121]</span><a
      name="link121" id="link121"></a>of étagère, and the throng of the drinkers
      form in line about the tap. For the rest, patience is soon acquired here;
      amid such idleness the mind goes to sleep, the fog puts an end to ideas,
      and you follow the crowd mechanically; you act only at the instigation of
      others, and you look at objects without receiving from them any reaction.

      After the first glass, you wait an hour before taking another; meanwhile
      you march up and down, elbowed by the dense groups, who drag themselves
      laboriously along between the columns. Not a seat to be had, except two
      wooden benches where the ladies sit, with their feet resting upon the damp
      stones: the economy of the administration supposes that the weather is
      always fine. Wearied and dejected faces pass before the eyes without
      awaking any interest. For the twentieth time you look over <span
      class="pagenum">[122]</span><a name="link122" id="link122"></a>the marble
      trinkets, the shop with razors and scissors, a map that hangs on the wall.
      What is there that one is not capable of on a rainy day, if obliged to
      keep moving for an hour between four walls, amidst the buzzing of two
      hundred people? You study the posters, contemplate assiduously some
      figures which pretend to represent the manners of the country: these are
      elegant and rosy shepherds, who lead to the dance smiling shepherdesses
      rosier than themselves. You stretch your neck out at the door only to see
      a gloomy passage where invalids are soaking their feet in a trough of warm
      water, all in a row like school-children on cleaning and excursion days.
      After these distractions you return to your lodging, and find yourselves
      tête-à-tête, in close conversation with your chest of drawers and your
      light-stand.

      People who have any appetite take refuge at the table; they did not count
      upon the musicians. First we saw a blind man come in, a heavy,
      thick-headed Spaniard, then the violinists of the country, then another
      blind man. They play pot-pourris of waltzes, country dances, bits from
      operas, strung one upon another, galloping along, above the note or below
      it, with admirable fearlessness, despoiling every repertory in their
      musical race. The next day we had three Germans, tall as towers, stiff as
      stones, perfectly phlegmatic, playing without a gesture and passing the
      plate without a word; at least they play in time.

    <p>
      On the third day the musicians of <span class="pagenum">[124]</span><a
      name="link124" id="link124"></a>a neighboring village appeared, a violin
      and flageolet; they executed their piece with such energy and discord, in
      tones so piercing, so long-drawn-out and rending, that, by universal
      consent, they were put out doors. They began again under the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good appetite is a consolation for all ills; so much the worse if you
      will, or so much the better for humanity. It is necessary to bear up
      against the tediousness, the rain and the music of Eaux Bonnes. The
      renewed blood then bears gayety to the brain, and the body persuades the
      soul that everything is for the best in the best of worlds. You will have
      pity on those poor musicians as you leave the table; Voltaire has proved
      that an easy digestion induces compassion, and that a good stomach gives a
      good heart. Between forty and fifty years of age, a man is handsome when,
      after dinner, he folds up his napkin and begins his indispensable
      promenade. He walks with legs apart, chest out, resting heavily on his
      stick, his cheeks colored by a slight warmth, humming between his teeth
      some old refrain of his youth; it seems to him that the universe is
      brought nicely together; he smiles and is bland, he is the first to reach
      you his hand. What machines we are! Yet why complain of it? My good
      neighbor would tell you that you have the key of your mechanism; <span

      On sunny days, we live in the open air. A sort of yard, called the English
      garden, stretches between the street and the mountain, carpeted with a
      poor turf, withered and full of holes; the ladies constitute it their
      drawing-room and work there; the dandies, lying on several chairs at once,
      read their journal and proudly smoke their cigar; the little girls, in
      embroidered pantalons, chatter with coquettish gestures and graceful
      little ways; they are trying in advance the parts they will play as lovely
      dolls. But for the red cassocks of the little jumping peasants, the aspect
      is that of the Champs Elysees. You leave this spot by beautiful shaded
      walks which mount in zigzags upon the flanks of the two <span
      class="pagenum">[127]</span><a name="link127" id="link127"></a>mountains,
      one above the torrent, the other above the city; toward noon, numbers of
      bathers may be met here lying upon the heather, nearly all with a novel in
      hand.

      Anomalous beeches sustain the slopes here; no description can give an idea

      class="pagenum">[128]</span><a name="link128" id="link128"></a>three men
      could not reach. Beaten back by the wind that desolates the declivity,
      their sap has been accumulating for centuries in huge, stunted, twisted
      and interlaced branches; all embossed with knots misshapen and blackened,
      they stretch and coil themselves fantastically, like limbs swollen by
      disease and distended by a supreme effort.

      Through the split bark may be seen the vegetable muscles enrolling
      themselves about the trunk, and crushing each other like the limbs of
      wrestlers. These squat torsos, half overthrown, almost horizontal, lean
      toward the plain; but their feet bury themselves among the rocks with such
      ties, that <span class="pagenum">[129]</span><a name="link129" id="link129"></a>sooner
      than break that forest of roots, one might tear out a side of the
      mountain. Now and then a trunk, rotted by water, breaks open, hideously
      eventerated; the edges of the wound spread farther apart with every year;
      they wear no longer the shape of trees, and yet they live, and cannot be
      conquered by winter, by their slope, nor by time, but boldly put forth
      into their native air their whitish shoots. If, under the shades of
      evening, you pass by the tortured tops and yawning trunks of these old
      inhabitants of the mountains, when the wind is beating the branches, you
      seem to hear a hollow plaint, extorted by a century&rsquo;s toil; these
      strange forms recall the fantastic creatures of the old Scandinavian
      mythology. You think on the giants imprisoned by fate, between walls that
      contracted day by day, and bent them down and lessened them, and then
      returned them to the light, after a thousand years of torture, furious,
      misshapen and dwarfed.

      Toward four o&rsquo;clock the cavalcades return; the small horses of the
      country are gentle, and gallop without too much effort; far away in the
      sunlight gleam the white and luminous veils of the ladies; nothing is more
      graceful than a pretty woman on horseback, when she is neither <span
      class="pagenum">[130]</span><a name="link130" id="link130"></a>imprisoned
      in a black riding-habit, nor topped with a chimney-pot hat. Nobody here
      wears this funereal, poverty-stricken English costume; in a gay country
      people assume gay colors; the sun is a oood counsellor. It is forbidden to
      return at a gallop, o which is reason enough why everybody should return
      at that gait. Ah, the great art of imitating the coming in of the cattle!
      They bend in the saddle, the highway resounds, the windows quiver, they
      sweep proudly before the saunterers who stop to gaze; it is a triumph; the
      administration of Eaux Bonnes does not know the human heart, especially
      the heart of woman.

      In the evening, everybody meets on a level promenade; it is a flat road
      half a league long, cut in the mountain of Gourzy. The remainder of the
      country is nothing but steeps and precipices; any one who for eight days
      has known the fatigue of climbing bent double, of stumbling down hill, of
      studying the laws of equilibrium while flat on his back, will find it
      agreeable to walk on level ground, and to move his feet freely without
      thinking of his head; it gives a perfectly new sensation of security and
      ease.

      The road winds along a wooded hill-side, furrowed by winter torrents into
      whitish ravines; a few wasted springs slip away under the stones in their
      stream beds, and cover them with climbing plants; you walk under the <span

      beeches, then skirt along an inclined plane, peopled with ferns, where
      feed the tinkling herds; the heat has abated, the air is soft, a perfume
      of healthy and wild verdure reaches you on the lightest breeze; fair
      white-robed promenaders pass by in the twilight with ruffles of lace and
      floating muslins that rise and flutter like the wings of a bird. Every day
      we went to a seat upon a rock at the end of this road; from there, through
      the whole valley of Ossau, you follow the torrent grown into a river; the
      rich valley, a mosaic of yellow harvests and green fields, broadly opens
      out to the confines of the landscape, and allows the eye to lose itself in
      the dim distance of Béarn. From each side three mountains strike out their
      feet towards the river, and cause the outline of the plain to rise and
      fall in waves; the furthest slope down like pyramids, and their pale blue
      declivities stand out upon the rosy zone of the dim sky. In the depth of
      the gorges it is already dark; but turn around and you may see the summit
      of the Ger, gleaming with a soft carnation cherishing the last smile of
      the sun.

      On Sunday a procession of fine toilets goes up toward the church. This
      church is a round box, of stone and plaster, built for fifty persons but
      made to hold two hundred. Every half-hour the tide of the faithful ebbs
      and flows. Invalid priests abound and say as many masses as may be wanted:
      everything at Eaux Bonnes suffers for want of room; they form in line for
      prayers as for drinking, and are as crowded at the chapel as at the tap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally a purveyor of public pleasures undertakes the duty of
      enlivening the afternoon; an eloquent poster announces the <i>jeu du
      canard</i>. They fasten a perch to a tree, a cord to the perch, and a duck
      to the cord; the most serious-minded people follow the preparation with
      marked interest. I have seen men who yawn at the opera form a ring, under
      a hot sun, for a whole hour in order to witness the decapitation of the
      poor hanging creature. If you are generous-minded and greedy <span

      sensations in addition, you give two sous to a small boy; in consideration
      of which he has his eyes bandaged, is made to turn round and round, has an
      old sabre given to him, and is pushed forward, in the midst of the
      laughter and outcry of the spectators.

      heed, and cuts away into the air. If by rare chance he hits the creature,
      if by rarer chance he strikes the neck, or if, indeed, he takes off the
      head by miracle, he carries off the duck to have it cooked, and eat it.
      The public is not exacting in matter of amusement. If it were announced
      that a mouse was to drown itself in a pool, they would run as if to a
      fire. <span class="pagenum">[136]</span><a name="link136" id="link136"></a>"Why
      not?&rdquo; said my neighbor, an odd, abrupt sort of man: &ldquo;This is a
      tragedy and a perfectly regular one; see if it has not all the classic
      parts. First, the exposition; the instruments of torture that are
      displayed, the crowd which comes together, the distance that is marked,
      the animal that is fastened up. It is a protasis of the complex order, as
      M. Lysidas used to say. Secondly, the action; every time that a small boy
      starts, you are in suspense, you rise on tip-toe, your heart leaps, you
      are as interested in the pendent animal as in a fellow-creature. Do you
      say that the action is always the same? Simplicity is the characteristic
      of great works, and this one is after the Indian style. Thirdly, the
      catastrophe; if ever it was bloody it is so here. As to the passions, they
      are those demanded by Aristotle, terror and pity. See how shiveringly the
      poor creature lifts its head, when it feels the current of air from the
      sword! With what a lamentable and resigned look it awaits the stroke! The
      chorus of spectators takes part in the action, praises or blames, just as
      in the antique tragedy. In short, the public is right in being amused, and
      pleasure is never wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk like la Harpe; this duck would accept his lot in patience,
      if he could hear you. And the ball, what do you say of that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worth as much as the one at the Hôtel de <span class="pagenum">[137]</span><a
      name="link137" id="link137"></a>France with fine people; our dancing is
      nothing but walking, a pretext for conversation. Look how the servants and
      the guides dance; such cuts and pigeon wings! they go into it from pure
      fun, with all their heart, they feel the pleasure of motion, the impulse
      of their muscles; this is the true dance invented by joy and the need of
      physical activity. These fellows fall to and handle each other like
      timbers. That great girl there is servant at my hotel; say, does not that
      tall figure, that serious air, that proud attitude, recall the statues of
      antiquity? Force and health are always the first of beauties. Do you think
      that the languid graces, the conventional smiles of our quadrilles would
      bring together all this crowd? We get further away from Nature with every
      day; our life is all in the brain, and we spend our time in composing and
      listening to set phrases. See how I am uttering them now; to-morrow, I
      turn over a new leaf, buy a stout stick, put on gaiters and tramp over the
      country. You do the same; let each go his own way, and try not to come
      together.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> have determined
      to find some pleasure in my walks; have come out alone by the first path
      that offered itself, and walk straight on as chance may lead. Provided you
      have noted two or three prominent points, you are sure of finding the way
      back. You can now enjoy the unexpected, and discover the country. To know
      where you are going and by what way is certain boredom; the imagination
      deflowers the landscape in advance. It works and builds according to its
      own pleasure; then when you reach your goal all must be overturned; that
      spoils your disposition; the mind keeps its bent, and the beauty it has
      fancied prejudices that which it sees; it fails to understand <span

      because it is already taken up with another. I suffered a most grievous
      disenchantment when I saw the sea for the first time: it was a morning in
      autumn; flecks of purplish cloud dappled the sky; a gentle breeze covered
      the sea with little uniform waves. I seemed to see one of those long
      stretches of beet-root that are found in the environs of Paris,
      intersected by patches of green cabbages and bands of russet barley. The
      distant sails looked like the wings of homeward-bound pigeons. The view
      seemed to me confined; the artists, in their pictures, had represented the
      sea as greater. It was three days before I could get back the sensation of
      immensity.

      At the bridge of Discoo, its standing-ground fails it altogether; it falls
      into an amphitheatre, from shelf to shelf, in jets that cross each other
      and mingle their flakes of foam; then under an arcade of rocks and stones,
      it eddies in deep basins, whose edges it has polished, and where the

      Suddenly it makes a leap of thirty feet in three dark masses, and rolls in
      silver spray down a funnel of verdure. A fine dew gushes over the turf and
      gives life to it, and its rolling pearls sparkle as they glide along the
      leaves. Our northern fields afford no notion of such vividness; this
      unceasing coolness with this fiery sun is needed in order to paint the
      vegetable robe with such a magnificent hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a great, wooded mountain-side stretch sloping away before me; the
      noonday sun beat down upon it; the mass of white rays pierced through the
      vault of the trees; the leaves glowed in splendor, either transparent or
      radiated. Over all this lighted slope no shadow could be distinguished; a
      warm, luminous evaporation covered all, like the white veil of a woman. I
      have often since seen this strange garb of the mountains, especially
      towards evening; the bluish atmosphere enclosed in the gorges becomes
      visible; it grows thick, it imprisons the light and makes it palpable. The
      eye delights in penetrating into the fair network of gold that envelopes
      the ridges, sensitive to the softness and depth of it; the salient edges
      lose their hardness, the harsh contours are softened; it is heaven,
      descending and lending its veil to cover the nakedness of the savage
      daughters of the earth. Pardon me these metaphors; I appear, <span
      class="pagenum">[144]</span><a name="link144" id="link144"></a>perhaps, to
      be studying turns of expression, and yet I am only recounting my
      sensations.

    <p>
      From this place a meadow-path leads to the gorge of the Serpent: this is a
      gigantic notch in the perpendicular mountain. The brook that runs through
      it crawls along overborne by heaped-up blocks; its bed is nothing but a
      ruin.

      You ascend along a crumbling pathway, clinging to the stems of box and to
      the edges of rocks; frightened lizards start off like an arrow, and cower
      in the clefts of slaty slabs. A leaden sun inflames the bluish rocks; the
      reflected rays make the air like a furnace. In this parched chaos the only
      life is that of the water, which glides, murmuring, beneath the stones. At
      the bottom of the ravine the mountain abruptly lifts its vertical wall to
      the height of two hundred feet; the water drops in long white threads
      along this polished wall, and turns its reddish tint to brown; during the
      whole fall it does not quit the cliff, but clings to it like silvery <span
      class="pagenum">[145]</span><a name="link145" id="link145"></a>tresses, or
      a pendent garland of convolvulus. A fine broad basin stays it for an
      instant at the foot of the mountain, and then discharges it in a streamlet

      These mountain streams are unlike those of the plains; nothing sullies
      them; they never have any other bed than sand or naked stone. However deep
      they may be, you may count their blue pebbles; they are transparent as the
      air. Rivers have no other diversity than that of their banks; their
      regular course, their mass always gives the same sensation; the Gave, on
      the other hand, is a forever-changing spectacle; the human face has not
      more marked, more diverse expressions. When the water, green and profound,
      sleeps beneath the rocks, its emerald eyes wear the treacherous look of a
      naiad who would charm the passer-by only to drown him; then, wanton that
      it is, leaps blindly between the rocks, turns its bed topsy-turvy, rises
      aloft in a tempest of foam, dashes itself impotently and furiously into
      spray against the bowlder that has vanquished it. Three steps further on,
      it subsides and goes frisking capriciously alongside the bank in changing
      eddies, braided with bands of light and shade, twisting voluptuously like
      an adder. When the rock of its bed is broad and smooth, it spreads out,
      veined with rose and azure, smilingly offering its level glass to the
      whole <span class="pagenum">[148]</span><a name="link148" id="link148"></a>mass
      of the sunlight. Over the bending plants, it threads its silent way in
      lines straight and tense as in a bundle of rushes, and with the spring and
      swiftness of a flying trout. When it falls opposite the sun, the hues of
      the rainbow may be seen trembling in its crystal threads, vanishing,
      reappearing, an aerial work, a sylph of light, alongside which a bee&rsquo;s
      wine would seem coarse, and which fairy fingers would in vain strive to
      equal.

      Seen in the distance, the whole Gave is only a storm of silvered falls,
      intersected by splendid blue expanses. Fiery and joyful youth, useless and
      full of poetry; to-morrow that troubled wave will receive the filth <span

      At the bottom of an ice-cold gorge rolls the cascade of Larresecq. It does
      not deserve its renown: it is a sort of dilapidated stairway with a dirty
      stream, lost among stones and shifting earth, awkwardly scrambling down
      it; but, in getting there, you pass by a profound steep-edged hollow,
      where the torrent rolls along swallowed up in the caverns it has scooped
      out, obstructed by the trunks of the trees that it uproots. Overhead,
      lordly oaks meet in arcades; the shrubs steep their roots far below in the
      turbulent stream. No sunlight penetrates into this dark ravine; the Gave
      pierces its way through, unseen and icy. At the outlet where it streams
      forth, you hear its hoarse outcry; it is struggling among the rocks that
      choke it: one might fancy-it a bull stricken by the pangs of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      This valley is solitary and out of the world; it is without culture; no
      tourists, not even herdsmen are to be found; three or four cows, perhaps,
      are there, busily cropping the herbage. Other gorges at the sides of the
      road and in the mountain of Gourzy are still wilder. There the faint trace
      of an <span class="pagenum">[150]</span><a name="link150" id="link150"></a>ancient
      pathway may with difficulty be made out.

      Can anything be sweeter than the certainty of being alone? In any widely
      known spot, you are in constant dread of an incursion of tourists; the
      hallooing of guides, the loud-voiced admiration, the bustle, whether of
      fastening horses, or of unpacking provisions, or of airing opinions, all
      disturb the budding sensation; civilization recovers its hold <span
      class="pagenum">[151]</span><a name="link151" id="link151"></a>upon you.
      But here, what security and what silence! nothing that recalls man; the
      landscape is just what it has been these six thousand years: the grass
      grows useless and free as on the first day; no birds among the branches;
      only now and then may be heard the far-off cry of a soaring hawk. Here and
      there the face of a huge, projecting rock patches with a dark shade the
      uniform plane of the trees: it is a virgin wilderness in its severe
      beauty. The soul fancies that it recognizes unknown friends of long ago;
      the forms and colors are in secret harmony with it; when it finds these
      pure, and that it enjoys them unmixed with outside thought, it feels that
      it is entering into its inmost and calmest depth&mdash;a sensation so
      simple, after the tumult of our ordinary thoughts, is like the gentle
      murmur of an Æolian harp after the hubbub of a ball.

    <p>
      Going down the Valentin, on the slope of the <i>Montagne Verte</i>, I
      found landscapes less austere. You reach the right bank of the Gave d&rsquo;Ossau.
      A pretty streamlet slips down the mountain, encased between two walls of
      rounded stones all purple with poppies and wild mallows. Its fall has been
      turned to account in driving rows <span class="pagenum">[152]</span><a
      name="link152" id="link152"></a>of saws incessantly back and forth over
      blocks of marble. A tall, bare-footed girl, in rags, ladles up sand and
      water for wetting the machine; by the aid of the sand the iron blade eats
      away the block.

    <p>
      A foot-path follows the river bank, lined with houses, huge oaks and
      fields of Indian corn; on the other side is an arid reach of pebbly shore,
      where children are paddling near some hogs <span class="pagenum">[153]</span><a
      name="link153" id="link153"></a>asleep in the sand; on the transparent
      wave, flocks of ducks rock with the undulations of the current: it is the
      country and culture after solitude and the desert. The pathway winds
      through a plantation of osiers and willows; the long, waving stalks that
      love the rivers, the pale pendent foliage, are infinitely graceful to eyes
      accustomed to the intense green of the mountains. On the right may be seen
      the narrow rocky ways that lead to the hamlets scattered over the slopes.
      The houses there lean their backs against the mountain, shelved one above
      another, so as to look down upon the valley. At noon the people are all
      absent. Every door is closed; three or four old women, who alone are left
      in the village, are spreading grain upon the level rock which forms the
      street or esplanade. What more singular than this long, natural
      flag-stone, carpeted with gilded heads of grain. The dark and narrow
      church ordinarily rises from a terraced yard, enclosed by a low wall; the
      bell-tower is white and square, with a slated spire. Under the porch may
      be read a few epitaphs carved in the stone; these, for the most part, are
      the names of invalids who have died at Eaux Bonnes; I remarked those of
      two brothers. To die so far from home and alone! It is touching to read
      these words of sympathy graven upon a tomb; this sunlight is so sweet! the
      <span class="pagenum">[154]</span><a name="link154" id="link154"></a>valley
      so beautiful! you seem to breathe health in the air; you want to live; one
      wishes, as the old poet says, &ldquo;Se réjouir longtemps de sa force et
      de sa jeunesse.&rdquo; The love of life is imparted with the love of
      light. How often, beneath the gloomy northern sky, do we form a similar
      desire?
    </p>
    <p>
      At the turn of the mountain is the entrance into an oak wood that rises on
      one of the declivities. These lofty, roomy forests give to the south shade
      without coolness. High up, among the trunks, shines a patch of blue sky;
      light and shade dapple the gray moss like a silken design upon a velvet
      ground. A heavy, warm air, loaded with vegetable emanations, rises to the
      face; it fills the chest and affects the head like wine. The monotonous
      sound of the cricket and the grasshopper comes from wheat-land and meadow,
      from mountain and from plain; you feel that living myriads are at work
      among the heather and under the thatch; and in the veins, where ferments
      the blood, courses a vague sensation of comfort, the uncertain state
      between sleeping and dreaming, which steeps the soul in animal life and
      stifles thought under the dull impressions of the senses. You stretch
      yourself out, and are content with merely living; you feel not the passage
      of the hours, but are happy in the present moment, without a thought for
      past or future; you gaze upon <span class="pagenum">[155]</span><a
      name="link155" id="link155"></a>the slender sprigs of moss, the grayish
      spikes of the grasses, the long ribands of the shining herbs; you follow
      the course of an insect striving to get over a thicket of turf, and
      clambering up and down in the labyrinth of its stalks. Why not confess
      that you have become a child again and are amused with the least of
      sights? What is the country but a means of returning to our earliest
      youth, of finding again that faculty of happiness, that state of deep
      attention, that indifference to everything but pleasure and the present
      sensation, that facile joy which is a brimming spring ready to overflow at
      the least impulse? I passed an hour beside a squadron of ants who were
      dragging the body of a big fly across a stone. They were bent upon the
      dismemberment of the vanquished; at each leg a little workwoman, in a
      black bodice, pulled and worked with all her might; the rest held the body
      in place. I never saw efforts more fearful; at times their prey rolled off
      the stone; then they had to begin over again. At last, fatigued by the
      toils of war, and wanting power to cut up and carry off the prey, they
      resigned themselves to eating it on the spot. <span class="pagenum">[156]</span><a

    <p>
      The view from Mount Gourzy is much admired; the traveller is informed that
      he will see the whole plain of Beam as far as Pau. I am obliged to take
      the word of the guide-book for it; I found clouds at the summit and saw
      nothing but the fog. At the end of the forest that covers the first slope
      lay some enormous trees, half rotten, and already whitened with moss. Some
      mummies of pine trees were left standing; but their pyramids of branches
      showed a shattered side. Old oaks split open as high up as a man&rsquo;s
      head, crowned their wound with mushrooms and red strawberries. From the
      manner in which the ground is strewn it might be called a battle-field
      laid waste by bullets; it is the herdsmen who, for mere amusement, set
      fire to the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      My neighbor, the tourist, told me next day that I had not lost much, and
      gave me a dissertation against the views from mountain-tops. He is a
      resolute traveller, a great lover of painting, very odd, however, and
      accustomed to believing nothing but himself, enthusiastic reasoner,
      violent in his opinions and fruitful in paradox. He is a singular man; at
      fifty, he is as active as if he were but twenty. He is dry, nervous,
      always well and alert, his legs <span class="pagenum">[157]</span><a
      name="link157" id="link157"></a>forever in motion, his head fermenting
      with some idea which has just sprung up in his brain and which during two
      days will appear to him the finest in the world. He is always under way
      and a hundred paces ahead of others, seeking truth with rash boldness,
      even to loving danger, finding pleasure in contradicting and being
      contradicted, and now and then deceived by his militant and adventurous
      spirit. He has nothing to hamper him; neither wife, children, place nor
      ambition. I like him, notwithstanding his want of moderation, because he
      is sincere; bit by bit he has told me his life, and I have found out his
      tastes; his name is Paul, and he was left, at the age of twenty, without
      parents and with an income of twelve thousand francs.

      From experience of himself and of the world, he judged that an occupation,
      an office or a household would weary him, and he has remained free. He
      found that amusements failed to amuse, and he gave up pleasures; he says
      that suppers give him the headache, that play makes him nervous, that a
      respectable mistress ties a man down, and a hired mistress disgusts him.
      So he has turned <span class="pagenum">[158]</span><a name="link158"
      id="link158"></a>his attention to travelling and reading. &ldquo;It is
      only water, if you will,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but that is better than
      your doctored wine: at least, it is better for my stomach.&rdquo; Besides,
      he finds himself comfortable under his system, and maintains that tastes
      such as his grow with age, that, in short, the most sensible of senses,
      the most capable of new and various pleasures is the brain. He confesses
      that he is dainty in respect of ideas, slightly selfish, and that he looks
      upon the world merely as a spectator, as if it were a theatre of
      marionettes. I grant that he is a thoroughly good fellow at heart, usually
      good-humored, careful not to step on the toes of others, at times
      calculated to cheer them up, and that, at least, he has the habit of
      remaining modestly and quietly in his corner. We have philosophized beyond
      measure between ourselves, or rather against one another; you may skip the
      following pages if you are not fond of dissertations.

      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know what they are doing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It
      is an absurdity of perspective. It is destroying a landscape for the
      better enjoyment of it. At such a distance there are neither forms nor
      colors. The heights are mere molehills, the villages are spots, the rivers
      are lines drawn by a pen. The objects are all lost in one grayish tint;
      the contrast <span class="pagenum">[159]</span><a name="link159"
      id="link159"></a>of lights and shades is blotted out; everything is
      diminished; you make out a multitude of imperceptible objects,&mdash;a
      mere Liliputian world. And thereupon you cry out at the magnificence! Does
      a painter ever take it into his head to scale a height in order to copy
      the score of leagues of ground that may be seen from thence?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;That is good only for a land-surveyor. The basins, highways,
      tillage, are all seen as in an atlas. Do you go then in search of a map? A
      landscape is a picture; you should put yourself at the point of sight. But
      no; the beauty is all ciphered mathematically; it is calculated that an
      elevation of a thousand feet makes it a thousand times more beautiful. The
      operation is admirable, and its only fault is that it is absurd, and that
      it leads through a great deal of fatigue to immeasurable boredom.&rdquo;
      <span class="pagenum">[160]</span><a name="link160" id="link160"></a>But
      the tourists, when once at the summit, are carried away with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pure cowardice&mdash;they are afraid of being accused of dryness,
      and of being thought prosy; everybody now-a-days has a sublime soul, and a
      sublime soul is condemned to notes of admiration. There are still
      sheep-like minds, who take their admirations on trust and get excited out
      of mere imitation. My neighbor says that this is fine, the book thinks so
      too; I have paid to come up, I ought to be charmed; accordingly I am. I
      was one day on a mountain with a family to whom the guide pointed out an
      indistinct bluish line, saying, &lsquo;There is Toulouse!&rsquo; The
      father, with sparkling eyes, repeated to the son, &lsquo;There is
      Toulouse!&rsquo; And he, at sight of so much joy, cried with transport,
      &lsquo;There is Toulouse!&rsquo; They learned to feel the beautiful, as
      any one learns to bow, through family tradition. It is so that artists are
      formed, and that the great aspects of Nature imprint forever upon the soul
      solemn emotions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then an ascent is an error of taste?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; if the plain is ugly, seen from above, the mountains
      themselves are beautiful; and indeed they are beautiful only from above.
      When you are in the valley they overwhelm you; you cannot take them in,
      you see only one side of them, you cannot appreciate their height nor
      their size. One <span class="pagenum">[161]</span><a name="link161"

      &ldquo;From the top of a peak, on the other hand, the mountains proportion
      themselves to our organs, the eye wanders over the ridges and takes in
      their whole; our mind comprehends them, because our body dominates them.
      Go to Saint-Sauveur, to <span class="pagenum">[162]</span><a name="link162"

      or an animal. Here you have found nothing but pretty details; the ensemble
      is tiresome.&rdquo;

      You talk of this country as a sick man of his doctor. What have you to say
      then against these mountains?
    </p>

      &ldquo;That they have no marked character; they have neither the austerity
      of bald peaks nor the lovely roundings of wooded hills. These fragments of
      grayish verdure, this poor mantle of stunted box pierced by the projecting
      bones of the rock, those scattered patches of yellowish moss, resemble
      rags; I like to have a person either naked or clothed, and do not like
      your tatterdemalion. The very forms are wanting in grandeur, the valleys
      are neither abrupt nor smiling. I do not find the perpendicular walls, the
      broad glaciers, the heaps of bald and jagged summits which are seen
      further on. The country does not amount to much either as plain or
      mountain; it should either be put forward or held back.&rdquo;

      parts stamped with the common idea and contributing to produce a single
      sensation. If it gives the lie here to what it says yonder, it destroys
      itself, and the spectator is in the presence of nothing but a mass of
      senseless objects. What though these objects be coarse, dirty, vulgar?
      provided they make up a whole by their harmony, and that they agree in
      giving us a single impression, we are pleased.&rdquo;

      So that a court-yard, a worm-eaten hut, a parched and melancholy plain,
      may be as beautiful as the sublimest mountain.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. You know the fields of the Flemish painters, how flat
      they are; you are never tired of looking at them. Take something that is
      still more trivial, an interior of Van Ostade; an old peasant is
      sharpening a chopping-knife in the corner, the mother is swaddling her
      nursling, three or four brats are rolling about among the tools, the
      kettles and benches; a row of hams is ranged in the chimney, and the great
      old bed is displayed in the background under its red curtains. What could
      be more common! But all these good people have an air of peaceful
      contentment; the babies are warm and easy in the over-wide breeches,
      glossy antiques transmitted from generation to generation. There must have
      been habits of security and abundance, for a scattered household to lie
      <span class="pagenum">[166]</span><a name="link166" id="link166"></a>pellmell
      on the ground in this fashion; this comfort must have lasted from father
      to son, for the furniture to have assumed that sombre color and all the
      hues to harmonize. There is not an object here that does not point to the
      unconstraint of an easygoing life and uniform good-nature. If this mutual
      fitness of the parts is the mark of fine painting, why not of fine nature?
      Real or fancied, the object is the same; I praise or I blame one with as
      good right as the other, because the practice or the violation of the same
      rules produces in me the same enjoyment or the same displeasure.&rdquo;

      Mountains then may have another beauty than that of grandeur? <span
      class="pagenum">[167]</span><a name="link167" id="link167"></a>"Yes, since
      they sometimes have a different expression. Look at that little isolated
      chain, against which the <i>Thermes</i> support themselves: nobody climbs
      it; it possesses neither great trees, nor naked rocks, nor points of view.
      And yet I experienced a genuine pleasure there yesterday; you follow the
      sharp backbone of the mountain that protrudes its vertebrae through its
      meagre coating of earth; the poor but thickset turf, sunburnt and beaten
      by the wind, forms a carpet firmly sewn with tenacious threads; the
      half-dried mosses, the knotty heaths strike their stubborn roots down
      between the clefts of the rock; the stunted firs creep along, twisting
      their horizontal trunks. An aromatic and penetrating odor, concentrated
      and drawn forth by the heat, comes from all these mountain plants. You
      feel that they are engaged in an eternal struggle against a barren soil, a
      dry wind, and a shower of fiery rays, driven back upon themselves,
      hardened to all inclemencies, and determined to live. This expression is
      the soul of the landscape; now, given so many varied expressions, you have
      so many different beauties, so many chords of passion are stirred. The
      pleasure consists in seeing this soul. If you cannot distinguish it, or if
      it be wanting, a mountain will make upon you precisely the effect of a

      of the mountain was torn out in order to open it; the wind eddies through
      the hollows of this chilly pass; the precipitous cut, of a dark
      iron-color, lifts its formidable mass as if to overwhelm the passerby;
      upon the rocky wall opposite are perched twisted trees in rows, and their
      thin, feathery tops wave strangely among the reddish projections. The

      Between two channelled granite towers stretches the little village of
      Eaux-Chaudes. But who, here, pays any attention to the village? All
      thought is taken up by the mountains. The eastern chain, abruptly cut off,
      drops perpendicularly like the wall of a citadel; at the summit, a
      thousand feet above the highway, are esplanades expanding in forests and
      meadows, a crown green and moist, whence cascades ooze forth by the
      hundred. They wind broken and flaky along the breast of the mountain, like
      necklaces of pearls told off between the fingers, bathing the feet of the
      lustrous oaks, deluging the bowlders with their tempest, then at last
      spreading themselves out in long beds where the level rock lures them to

      id="link174"></a>loaded with wood to the very top; several of them rise,
      in all their blackness, into the heart of the light, and their fringe of
      trees bristles against the pale sky. The charming cup of verdure rounds
      its gilded margin, then drops into hollows, overflowing with birch and
      oak, with tender, changeable hues that lend additional sweetness to the
      mists of morning. Not a hamlet is to be seen, no smoke, no culture; it is
      a wild and sunny nest, no doubt like to the valley that, on the finest day
      of the happiest springtide of the universe, received the first man.

      The highway makes a turn, and everything changes. The old troop of parched
      mountains reappears with a threatening air. One of them <span
      class="pagenum">[175]</span><a name="link175" id="link175"></a>in the west
      is crumbling, shattered as if by a cyclopean hammer. It is strewn with
      squared blocks, dark vertebræ snatched from its spine; the head is
      wanting, and the monstrous bones, crushed and in disorder, scattered to
      the brink of the Gave, announce some ancient defeat. Another lying
      opposite, with a dreary air, extends its bald back a league away; in vain
      you go on or change your view: it is always there, always huge and
      melancholy. Its naked granite suffers neither tree nor spot of verdure; a
      few patches of snow alone whiten the hollows in its sides, and its
      monotonous ridge shifts sadly its lines, blotting out half the sky with
      its bastions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabas is a hamlet in a barren plain. The torrent here rumbles underneath
      glaciers and among shattered tree-trunks; it descends, lost at the bottom
      of the declivity, between colonnades of pines, the mute inhabitants of the
      gorge. The silence and constraint contrast with the desperate leaps of the
      snowy water. It is cold here, and everything is sad; only, on the horizon
      may be seen the Pic du Midi in its splendor, lifting its two jagged piles
      of tawny gray into the serene light.

      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In spite of myself I have been dreaming here of the antique gods, sons of
      Greece, and made in the likeness of their country. They were born in a
      similar country, and they spring to life again here in ourselves, with the
      sentiments which gave birth to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I imagine idle and curious herdsmen, of fresh and infantile souls, not yet
      possessed by the authority of a neighboring civilization and an
      established dogma, but active, hardy, and poets by nature. They dream&mdash;and
      of what, if not of the huge beings that all day long besiege their eyes?
      How fantastical are those jagged heads, those bruised and heaped-up
      bodies, those twisted shoulders! What unknown monsters, what melancholy,
      misshapen race, alien to humanity! By what-dread travail has the earth
      brought them forth from her womb, and what contests have their blasted
      heads sustained amidst clouds and thunderbolts! They still threaten
      to-day; the eagles and the vultures are alone welcome to sound their
      depths. They love not man; their bowlders lie in wait to roll upon him, so
      soon as he shall violate their solitudes. With a shiver they hurl upon his
      harvests a tide of rocks; they have but to gather up a storm in order to
      drown him like an ant. <span class="pagenum">[177]</span><a name="link177"

      How changeable is their face, but always to be dreaded! What lightnings
      their summits hurl among the creeping fogs! That flash causes fear like
      the eye of some tyrant god, seen for a moment, then hid again. There are
      mountains that weep, amidst their gloomy bogs, and their tears trickle
      down their aged cheeks with a hollow sob, betwixt pines that rustle and
      whisper sorrowfully, as if pitying that eternal mourning. Others, seated
      in a ring, bathe their feet in lakes the color of steel, and which no wind
      ever ruffles; they are happy in such calm, and gaze into the virgin wave
      at their silver helmet. How mysterious are they at night, and what evil
      thoughts do they turn over in winter, when wrapped in their shroud of
      snow! But in the broad day and in summer, with what buoyancy and how
      glorified rises their forehead to the sublimest heights of air, into pure
      and radiant realms, into light, to their own native country. All scarred
      and monstrous though they be, they are still the gods of the earth, and
      they have aspired to be gods of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      But lo, where comes a second race, lovely and almost human, the choir of
      the nymphs, fleeting and melting creatures who are daughters of those
      misshapen colossuses. How comes it that they have begotten them? No one
      knows; the birth <span class="pagenum">[180]</span><a name="link180"
      id="link180"></a>of the gods, full of mystery, eludes mortal eye. Some say
      that their first pearl has been seen to ooze from an herb, or from a
      cranny beneath the glaciers, in the uplands. But they have dwelt long in
      the paternal bowels; some, burning ones, keep the memory of that inner
      furnace whose bubbling they have looked upon, and which, from time to
      time, still makes the ground to tremble; others, icy cold, have crossed
      the eternal winter that whitens the summits. At the outset, all retain the
      fire of their race; dishevelled, screaming, raving, they bruise themselves
      against the rocks, they cleave the valleys, sweep away trees, struggle and
      are sullied. What transport is here&mdash;maidenly and bacchanal! But,
      once they have reached the smooth beds which the rounded rock spreads out
      for them, they smile, they hush themselves in sleep, or they sport. Their
      deep eyes of liquid emerald have their flashes. Their bodies bow and rise
      again; in the vapors of morning, in sudden falls, their water swells, soft
      and satiny as a woman&rsquo;s breast. With what tenderness, what
      delicately wild quiverings they caress the bended flowers, the shoots of
      fragrant thyme that thrive between two rocky edges on the bank! Then with
      sudden caprice they plunge deep down in a cavern, and scream and writhe as
      mad and wayward as any child. What happiness in spreading <span
      class="pagenum">[181]</span><a name="link181" id="link181"></a>out thus to
      the sun! What strange gayety, or what divine tranquillity, in that
      transparent wave as it laughs or eddies! Neither the eye nor the diamond
      has that changeful clearness, those burning and glaucous reflections,
      those inward tremblings of pleasure or of anxiety; women though they are,
      they are indeed goddesses. Without more than human might, would they have
      availed, with their soft wave, to wear these hard cliffs, to bore through
      these impregnable barriers? And by what secret virtue do they know, they,
      so innocent of aspect, how at one time to torture and slay him who drinks,
      and, again, to heal the infirm and the invalid? They hate the one and love
      the other, and, like their fathers, they bestow life and death at their
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the poetry of the pagan world, of the childhood of mankind; thus
      each one framed it for himself, in the dawn of things, at the awaking of
      imagination and conscience, long before the age when reflection set up
      defined worship and studied dogmas. Among the dreams that blossomed in the
      morning of the world, I love only those of Ionia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon Paul became vexed, and called me a classicist: &ldquo;You are all
      like that! You take one step forward into an idea, and then stop short
      like cowards. Come now; there are a hundred Olympuses <span class="pagenum">[182]</span><a
      name="link182" id="link182"></a>in Egypt, in Iceland, in India. Each one
      of those landscapes is an aspect of Nature; each of those Gods is one of
      the forms in which man has expressed his idea of Nature. Admire the god by
      the same standard as the landscape; the onion of Egypt is worth as much as
      Olympian Jove.&rdquo; That is too strong, yet I take you at your word; you
      shall stand by your assertion, and extract a god from your onion.

      &ldquo;This very instant; but first transport yourself to Egypt, before
      the coming of warriors and priests, upon the river-ooze, among savages
      half naked in the mire, half drowned in water, half burned by the sun.
      What a sight is that of this great black shore steaming under the heat,
      where <span class="pagenum">[183]</span><a name="link183" id="link183"></a>crocodiles
      and writhing fish lash the waters of the pools! Myriads of mosquitoes buzz
      in the air; large-leaved plants lift their tangled mass; the earth
      ferments and teems with life; the brain grows giddy with the heavy
      exhalations, and man, made restless, shudders as he feels in the air and
      coursing through his limbs the generative virtue by whose means everything
      multiplies and grows green. A year ago nothing grew on this ooze: what a
      change! There springs from it a tall, straight reed, with shining thongs,
      the stem, swollen with juices, striking deep into the slime; with every
      day it expands and changes: green at the outset, it reddens like the sun
      behind the mists. Unceasingly does this child of the ooze suck therefrom
      juices and force; the earth broods over it and commits to it its every
      virtue. See it now, how, of its own accord, it lifts itself half-way, and
      at last wholly, and warms in the sun its scaly belly filled with an acrid
      blood; blood that boils, and so exuberant that it bursts the triple skin
      and oozes through the wound! What a strange life! and by what miracle is
      it that the point of the summit becomes a plume and a parasol? Those who
      first gathered it wept, as though some poison had burned their eyes; but
      in the winter-time, when fish fails, it rejoices him who meets it. Those
      enormous heaped-up globes, are they not the hundred breasts of the great
      nurse, <span class="pagenum">[184]</span><a name="link184" id="link184"></a>mother
      Earth? New ones reappear as often as the waters retire; there is some
      divine force hidden beneath those scales. May it never fail to return! The
      crocodile is god, because it devours us; the ichneumon is god, because it
      saves us; the onion is god, because it nourishes us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The onion is god, and Paul is its prophet; you shall have some this
      evening, with white sauce. But, my dear friend, you frighten me; you blot
      out with one stroke three thousand years of history. You put on one level
      races of artists and races of visionaries, savage tribes and civilized
      nations. I like the crocodile and the onion, but I like Jupiter and Diana
      better. The Greeks have invented the arts and sciences; the Egyptians have
      only left some heaps of ashlar-work. A block of granite is not as good as
      either Aristotle or Homer. They are everywhere the first who, through
      clear reasoning, have reached a conception of justice and have made
      science. Then, however evil our time may be, it surpasses many another.
      Your grotesque and oriental hallucinations are beautiful, at a distance
      however; I am willing to contemplate them, but not to submit to them.
      Now-a-days we have no poetry, be it so; but we appreciate the poetry of
      others. If our museum is poor, we have the museums of all ages and all
      nations. Do you know what I get from your theories? Three times a <span
      class="pagenum">[185]</span><a name="link185" id="link185"></a>month they
      will save me four francs; I shall find fairy-land in them, and shall have
      no further occasion for going to the opera.

      August, at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the piercing note of a
      flageolet was to be heard at half a league&rsquo;s distance from
      Eaux-Bonnes, and the bathers set out for Aas. The way there is by a narrow
      road cut in the Montagne Verte, and overhung with lavender and bunches of
      wild flowers. We entered upon a street six feet in width: it is the main
      street. Scarlet-capped children, wondering at their own magnificence,
      stood bolt upright in the doorways and looked on us in silent admiration.
      The public square, at the side of the lavatory, is as large as a small
      room; <span class="pagenum">[187]</span><a name="link187" id="link187"></a>it

      Two hogsheads had been set up, two planks upon the hogsheads, two chairs
      upon the planks, and on the chairs two musicians, the whole surmounted by
      two splendid blue umbrellas which did service as parasols; for the sky was
      brazen, and there was not a tree on the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole formed an exceedingly pretty and original picture. Under the
      roof of the lavatory, a <span class="pagenum">[188]</span><a name="link188"
      id="link188"></a>group of old women leaned against the pillars in talk; a
      crystal stream gushed forth and ran down the slated gutter; three small
      children stood motionless, with wide-open, questioning eyes. The young men
      were at exercise in the pathway, playing at base. Above the esplanade, on
      points of rock forming shelves, the women looked down on the dance, in
      holiday costume; a great scarlet hood, a body embroidered in silver, or in
      silk with violet flowers; a yellow, long-fringed shawl; a black petticoat
      hanging in folds, close to the figure, and white woollen gaiters. These
      strong colors, the lavished red, the reflexes of the silk under a dazzling
      light, were delightful. About the two hogsheads was wheeling, with a
      supple, measured movement, a sort of roundelay, to an odd and monotonous
      air terminated by a shrill false note of startling effect. A youth in
      woollen vest and breeches led the band; the young girls moved gravely,
      without talking or laughing; their little sisters at the end of the file
      took great pains in practising the step, and the line of purple <i>capulets</i>
      slowly waved like a crown of peonies. Occasionally the leader of the dance
      gave a sudden bound with a savage cry, and recalled to our mind that we
      were in the land of bears, in the very heart of the mountains.

    <p>
      Paul was there under his umbrella, wagging his <span class="pagenum">[189]</span><a

      been able, he would have followed the dance.

      &ldquo;Was I right? Is there a single things here out of harmony with the
      rest, and which the sun, the climate, the soil, do not make suitable?
      These people are poets. They must have been in love with the light to have
      invented these splendid costumes. Never would a northern sun have inspired
      this feast of color; their costume harmonizes with their sky. In Flanders,
      they would look like mountebanks; here they are as beautiful as their
      country. You no longer notice the ugly features, the sunburnt faces, the
      thick, knotty hands that yesterday offended you; the sun enlivens the
      brilliancy of the dresses, and in that golden splendor all ugliness
      disappears. I have seen people who <span class="pagenum">[190]</span><a
      name="link190" id="link190"></a>laughed at the music; &lsquo;the air is
      monotonous,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;contrary to all rule, it has no
      ending; those notes are false.&rsquo; At Paris, that may be; but here, no.
      Have you remarked that wild and original expression? How it suits the
      landscape! That air could have sprung up nowhere but among the mountains.
      The frou-frou of the tambourine is as the languid voice of the wind when
      it coasts the narrow valleys; the shrill tone of the flageolet is the
      whistling of the breeze when it is heard on the naked summits; that final
      note is the cry of a hawk in the depths of the air; the mountain sounds
      too are recognizable, hardly transformed by the rhythm of the song. And
      then the dance is as primitive, as natural, as suitable to the country as
      the music: they go wheeling about hand in hand. What could be more simple!
      It is thus that the children do at their play. The step is supple and
      slow; that is as the mountaineer walks; you know by experience that you
      must not be in too much haste if you would climb, and that here the stiff
      strides of a town-bred man will bring him to the ground. That leap, that
      seems to you so strange, is one of their habits, hence one of their
      pleasures. To make up a festival they have chosen what they found
      agreeable among the things to which their eyes, ears, and legs were
      habituated. Is not this festival then the most national, the <span
      class="pagenum">[191]</span><a name="link191" id="link191"></a>truest, the
      most harmonious, and hence the most beautiful that can be imagined?&rdquo;

      Laruns is a market-town. Instead of a hogshead there were four times two
      hogsheads and as many musicians, all playing together, and each one a
      different portion of the same air. This clatter excepted and a few
      magnificent pairs of velvet breeches, the festival was the same as that at
      Aas. What we go there to see is the procession.

      At first everybody attends vespers; the women in the sombre nave of the

      up, under the eye of a frowning schoolmaster. The young girls, kneeling
      close to the gratings of the choir, repeated <i>Ave Marias</i>, to which
      the deep voice of the congregation responded; their clear, metallic voices
      formed a pretty contrast to the hollow buzzing of the resounding
      responses. Some wolfish-looking old mountaineers, from thirty miles away,
      made the blackened wood of the balustrade creak as they clumsily bent the
      knee. A twilight fell on the dense crowd, and made yet darker the
      expression of those energetic countenances. One might have fancied himself
      in the sixteenth <span class="pagenum">[192]</span><a name="link192"
      id="link192"></a>century. Meanwhile the little bells chattered joyously
      with their shrill voices, and made all possible noise, like a roost full
      of fowls at the top of the white tower.

      At the end of an hour, the procession arranged itself very artistically
      and went forth. The first part of the cortege was amusing: two rows of
      little scapegraces in red vests, their hands clasped over their bellies,
      in order to keep their book in <span class="pagenum">[193]</span><a
      name="link193" id="link193"></a>place, tried to give themselves an air of
      compunction, and looked at each other out of the corners of their eyes in
      a manner truly comical. This band of masquerading monkeys was led by a
      jolly stout priest, whose folded bands, cuffs, and hanging laces fluttered
      and waved like wings. Then a sorry beadle, in a soiled <i>douanier&rsquo;s</i>
      coat; then a fine maire in uniform, with his sword at his side; then two
      long seminarians, two plump little priests, a banner of the Virgin,
      finally all the douaniers and all the gendarmes of the country; in short,
      all the grandeurs, all the splendors, all the actors of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barbarians however were more beautiful: it was the procession of men
      and women who, taper in hand, filed by during three-quarters of an hour. I
      saw in it true Henry IV. faces, with the severe and intelligent
      expression, the proud and serious bearing, the large features of his
      contemporaries. Especially there were some old herdsmen in russet
      great-coats of hairy felt, their brows not wrinkled but farrowed, bronzed
      and burned by the sun, their glances savage as those of a wild beast,
      worthy of having lived in the time of Charlemagne. Surely those who defied
      Roland were not more savage in physiognomy. Finally appeared five or six
      old women, the like of whom I could never have imagined: a hooded cloak of
      white woollen <span class="pagenum">[194]</span><a name="link194"
      id="link194"></a>stuff enfolded them like a bed-blanket; only the swarthy
      countenance was visible, their eyes deep and fierce like the she-wolf&rsquo;s,
      their mumbling lips, that seemed to be muttering spells. They called to
      mind involuntarily the witches in Macbeth; the mind was transported a
      hundred leagues away from cities, into barren gorges, beneath lone
      glaciers where the herdsmen pass whole months amidst the snows of winter,
      near to the growling bears, without hearing one human word, with no other
      companions than the gaunt peaks and the dreary fir-trees. They have
      borrowed from solitude something of its aspect.

      <span class="pagenum">[197]</span><a name="link197" id="link197"></a>The
      Ossalais, however, have ordinarily a gentle, intelligent, and somewhat sad
      physiognomy. The soil is too poor to impart to their countenance that
      expression of impatient vivacity and lively spirit that the wine of the
      south and the easy life give to their neighbors of Languedoc. Three-score
      leagues in a carriage prove that the soil moulds the type. A little
      farther up, in the Cantal, a country of chest-nut-trees, where the people
      fill themselves with a hearty nourishment, you will see countenances red
      with sluggish blood and set with a thick beard, fleshy, heavy-limbed
      bodies, massive machines for labor. Here the men are thin and pale; their
      bones project, and their large features are weatherbeaten like those of
      their mountains. An endless struggle against the soil has stunted the
      women as well as the plants; it has left in their eyes a vague expression
      of melancholy and reflection. Thus the incessant impressions of body and
      soul in the long run modify body and soul; the race moulds the individual,
      the country moulds the race. A degree of heat in the air and of
      inclination in the ground is the first cause of our faculties and of our
      passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disinterestedness is not a mountain virtue. In a poor country, the first
      want is want of money. <span class="pagenum">[198]</span><a name="link198"
      id="link198"></a>The dispute is to know whether they shall consider
      strangers as a prey or a harvest; both opinions are true: we are a prey
      which every year yields a harvest. Here is an incident, trifling, but
      capable of showing the dexterity and the ardor with which they will skin a
      flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Paul told his servant to sew another button upon his trousers. An
      hour after she brings in the trousers, and, with an undecided, anxious
      air, as if fearing the effect of her demand: &ldquo;It is a sou,&rdquo;
      said she. I will explain later how great a sum the sou is in this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul draws out a sou in silence and gives it to her. Jeannette retires on
      tip-toe as far as the door, thinks better of it, returns, takes up the
      trousers and shows the button: &ldquo;Ah! that is a fine button! (A
      pause.) I did not find <i>that</i> in my box. (Another and a longer
      pause.) I bought that at the grocer&rsquo;s; it costs a sou!&rdquo; She
      draws herself up anxiously; the proprietor of the trousers, still without
      speaking, gives a second sou.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that she has struck upon a mine of sous. Jeannette goes out,
      and a moment after reopens the door. She has resolved on her course, and
      in a shrill, piercing voice, with admirable volubility: &ldquo;I had no
      thread; I had to buy some thread; I used a good deal of thread; good
      thread, too. The button won&rsquo;t come off. I sewed it on <span
      class="pagenum">[199]</span><a name="link199" id="link199"></a>fast: it
      cost a sou.&rdquo; Paul pushes across the table the third sou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, Jeannette, who has been pondering on the matter,
      reappears. She prepares breakfast with the greatest possible care; she
      takes pains to wipe the least spot, she lowers her voice, she walks
      noiselessly, she is charming in her little attentions; then she says,
      putting forth all sorts of obsequious graces: &ldquo;I ought not to lose
      anything, you would not want me to lose anything; the cloth was harsh, I
      broke the point of my needle; I did not know it a while ago, I have just
      noticed it; it cost a sou.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul drew out the fourth sou, saying with his serious air: &ldquo;Cheer
      up, Jeannette; you will keep a good house, my child; happy the husband who
      shall lead you, pure and blushing, beneath the roof of his ancestors; you
      may go and brush the trousers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Beggars swarm. I have never met a child between the ages of four and
      fifteen years who did not ask alms of me; all the inhabitants follow this
      trade. No one is ashamed of it. You look at any one of the little girls,
      scarcely able to walk, seated at their threshold busy in eating an apple:
      they come stumbling along with their hands stretched out towards you. You
      find in a valley a young herdsman with his cows; he comes up and asks
      <span class="pagenum">[200]</span><a name="link200" id="link200"></a>you
      for a trifle. A tall girl goes by with a fagot on her head; she stops and
      asks a trifle of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      A peasant is at work on the road. &ldquo;I am making a good road for you,&rdquo;
      says he; &ldquo;give me just a trifle.&rdquo; A band of scapegraces are
      playing at the end of a promenade; as soon as they see you, they take each
      other by the hand, begin the dance of the country, and end by collecting
      the usual trifle. And so it is throughout the Pyrenees. <span

      And they are merchants as well as beggars. You rarely pass along the
      street without being accosted by a guide who offers you his services and
      begs you to give him the preference. If you are seated on the hillside,
      three or four children come dropping out of the sky, bringing you
      butterflies, stones, curious plants, bouquets of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you go near a dairy, the proprietor comes out with a porringer of milk,
      and will sell it to you in spite of yourself. One day as I was looking at
      a young bull, the drover proposed to me to buy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This greediness is not offensive. I once went up the brook of la Soude,
      behind Eaux-Bonnes: it is a sort of tumbledown staircase which for three
      leagues winds among the box in a parched ravine. You have to clamber over
      pointed rocks, jump from point to point, balance yourself along narrow
      ledges, climb zigzag up the scarped slopes covered with rolling stones.
      The foot-path is enough to frighten the goats. You bruise your feet on it,
      and at every step <span class="pagenum">[202]</span><a name="link202"
      id="link202"></a>run the risk of getting a sprain. I met there some young
      women and girls of twenty, all barefooted, carrying to the village, one a
      block of marble in her basket, another three sacks of charcoal fastened
      together, another five or six heavy planks; the way is nine miles long,
      under a mid-day sun; and nine miles for the home journey: for this they
      are paid ten sous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the beggars and the merchants, they are very crafty and very polite.
      Poverty forces men to calculate and to please; they take off their cap as
      soon as you speak to them and smile complaisantly; their manners are never
      brutal or artless. The proverb says very truly: &ldquo;False and courteous
      Béarnais.&rdquo; You recall to mind the caressing manners and the perfect
      skill of their Henry IV.; he knew how to play on everybody and offend
      nobody. In this respect, as in many others, he was a true Béarnais. With
      the aid of necessity, I have seen them trump up geological disquisitions.
      In the middle of July there was a sort of earthquake; a report was spread
      that an old wall had fallen down; in truth the windows had shaken as if a
      great wagon were passing by. Immediately half of the bathers quitted their
      lodgings: a hundred and fifty persons fled from Cauterets in two days;
      travellers in their night-shirts ran to the stable to fasten on their
      carriages, and to light themselves carried away the <span class="pagenum">[203]</span><a
      name="link203" id="link203"></a>hotel lantern. The peasants shook their
      heads compassionately and said to me: &ldquo;You see, sir, they are going
      from the frying-pan into the fire; if there is an earthquake, the plain
      will open, and they will fall into the crevices, whereas here the mountain
      is solid, and would keep them safe as a house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That same Jeannette who already holds so honorable place in my history,
      shall furnish an example of the polite caution and the over-scrupulous
      reserve in which they wrap themselves when they are afraid that they shall
      be compromised. The master had drawn the neighboring church, and wanted to
      judge of his work after the manner of Molière.

    <p>
      We had a wish to know if the fathers were equal to the sons; and we have
      found the history of Bearn in a fine red folio, composed in the year 1640,
      by Master Pierre de Marca, a Béarnais, counsellor of the king in his state
      and privy councils, and president in his court of the parliament of
      Navarre; the whole ornamented with a magnificent engraving representing
      the conquest of the Golden Fleece. Pierre de Marca makes several important
      discoveries in his book, among others, that of two kings of Navarre,
      personages of the ninth century, until then unknown: Séméno Ennéconis, and
      En-néco Séménonis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although filled with respect for Sémêno Ennéconis and Enneco Semenonis, we
      are desperately wearied with the recital of the suits, the robberies <span
      class="pagenum">[205]</span><a name="link205" id="link205"></a>and the
      genealogies of all the illustrious unknown. Paul maintains that learned
      history is only good for learned asses; a thousand dates do not make a
      single idea. The celebrated historian of the Swiss, Jean de Muller, once
      wanted to rehearse the list of all the Swiss nobility, and forgot the
      fifty-first descendant of some undiscoverable viscount; he became ill with
      grief and shame; it is as if a general should wish to know how many
      buttons each of his soldiers had on his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have found that these good mountaineers have ever loved gain and booty.
      It is so natural to wish to live, and live well too! Above all is it
      pleasant to live at the expense of others! Time was when, in Scotland,
      every shipwrecked vessel belonged to the coast-side people; the wrecked
      ships came to them like herrings in the season, a hereditary and
      legitimate harvest; they felt robbed if one of the crew attempted to keep
      his coat. It is so here with strangers. The rear-guard of Charlemagne,
      under Roland, perished here; the mountaineers rolled down upon it an
      avalanche of stone; then they divided the stuffs, the silver, mules and
      baggage, and each one betook himself to his den. In the like manner they
      treated a second army sent by Louis le Débonnaire. I fancy they regarded
      these passages as a blessing from heaven, a special gift from divine
      Providence. <span class="pagenum">[206]</span><a name="link206"

      Fine cuirasses, new lances, necklaces, well-lined coats, it was a perfect
      magazine of gold, iron, and wool. Very likely the wives ran to meet them,
      blessing the good husband who had been the most thoughtful of the welfare
      of his little family, and brought back the greatest quantity of
      provisions. This artlessness in respect of theft still exists in Calabria.
      In Napoleon&rsquo;s time, a prefect was scolding a well-to-do peasant wild
      was behind-hand with his contributions; the peasant replied, with all the
      openness of an upright man: &ldquo;Faith, <span class="pagenum">[207]</span><a

    <p>
      Add to this custom of thieving an extreme bravery! I believe the country
      is the cause of one as well as the other; extreme poverty removes timidity
      as well as scruples; they are leeches on the body of others, but then they
      are equally prodigal of their own; they can resist as well as take an
      advantage; if they willingly take another&rsquo;s goods, they guard their
      own yet more willingly. Liberty has thriven here from the earliest times,
      crabbed and savage, home-born and tough like a stem of their own boxwood.
      Hear the tone of the primitive charter: <span class="pagenum">[208]</span><a
      name="link208" id="link208"></a>"These are the tribunals of Bearn, in
      which mention is made of the fact that, in old times, in Beam they had no
      lord, and in those days they heard the praises of a certain knight. They
      sought him out, and made him their lord during one year; and after that,
      he was unwilling to maintain among them their tribunals and customs. And
      the court of Bearn then came together at Pau, and they required of him to
      maintain among them their tribunals and customs. And he would not, and
      thereupon they killed him in full court.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In like manner the land of Ossau preserved its privileges, even against
      its viscount. Every robber who brought his booty into the valley was safe
      there, and might the next day present himself before the viscount with
      impunity: it was only when the latter, or his wife in his absence, came
      into the valley to dispense justice that he was judged. This scarcely ever
      happened, and the land of Ossau was &ldquo;the retreat of all the evil
      livers and marauders&rdquo; of the country round.

      These rude manners, filled with chances and dangers, produced as many
      heroes as brigands. First comes the Count Gaston, one of the leaders of
      the first crusade; he was, like all the great <span class="pagenum">[209]</span><a
      name="link209" id="link209"></a>men of this country, an enterprising and a
      ready-minded man, a man of experience and one of the vanguard. At
      Jerusalem he went ahead to reconnoitre, and constructed the machines for
      the siege; he was held to be one of the wisest in counsel, and was the
      first to plant upon the walls the cows of Bearn. No one struck a heavier
      blow or calculated more exactly, and no one was fonder of calculating and
      striking. On his return, he fought against his neighbors, twice besieged
      Saragossa, and once Bayonne, and, along with king Alphonso, won two great
      battles against the Moors. Ah, what a time was that, for minds and muscles
      framed for adventure! No need then to seek for war; it was found
      everywhere, and profit along with it.

      Such a fine career as those cavalcades had among the marvellous cities of
      the Asiatic Saracens and of the Spanish Moors! What a quantity of skulls
      to cleave, of gold to bring home! It was thus that the overflow of force
      and imagination was discharg was no foolish affair of a random shot or
      clumsy <span class="pagenum">[210]</span><a name="link210" id="link210"></a>bullet,
      in the midst of a well-ordered manouvre. Then one encountered all the
      hazards, the unforeseen, of knight-errantry; the senses were all awake;
      the arms wrought and the body was a soldier; Gaston was killed as a
      private horseman in ambuscade, with the bishop of Huesca.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which pleases me in history is the minor circumstances, the details
      of character. A mere scrap of a phrase indicates a revolution in the
      faculties and passions; great events are contained in it at their ease, as
      in their cause. Here in the life of Gaston is one of those words. The day
      that Jerusalem was taken, quarter had been granted to a large number of
      Mussulmans. &ldquo;But the next day, the rest, displeased at seeing that
      there were any infidels alive, mounted upon the roofs of the temple, and
      massacred and mangled all the Saracens, both men and women.&rdquo; * There
      was neither reasoning nor deliberation; at the sight of a Mussulman&rsquo;s
      dress, their blood mounted in wrath to their face, and they sprang
      forward, like lions or butchers, struck them down and dismembered them.
      Lope de Vega, an antique Christian, a severe Spaniard, renewed this savage
      and fanatical sentiment:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* The following fact is from the Siege of Antioch: &ldquo;Many of
our enemies died, and some of the prisoners were led before
the gate of the city, and there their heads were cut off, in
order to discourage those who remained in the city.&rdquo;

      Old Tello. And why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia. Because they believe neither in God nor in the Virgin Mary; the
      sight of them makes my blood boil, Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Tello. Are you afraid of them?

    <p>
      Garcia. No more than you, Father. (<i>Going toward the prisoners.</i>)

      to be a Christian. (He darts upon them and pursues them.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Tello. Ah, the good little fellow! Gracious Heaven! He is fine as
      coral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tello. Mendo, see that he does them no harm.

      In fact, they are falcons or vultures. In the song of Roland, when the

      But at the same time they have the mind and the soul of children. &ldquo;Deep
      are the wells, and the valleys dark, the rocks black, the defiles
      marvellous.&rdquo; That is their whole description of the Pyrenees; they
      feel and speak <i>in a lump</i>. A child, questioned about Paris, which he
      had just seen for the first time, <span class="pagenum">[212]</span><a
      name="link212" id="link212"></a>replied: &ldquo;There are a great many
      streets, and carriages everywhere, and great houses, and in two squares
      two tall columns.&rdquo; The poet of old times is like the child; he does
      not know how to analyze his impressions. Like him, he loves the
      marvellous, and takes delight in tales where all the proportions are
      gigantic.

      In the battle of Roncevaux everything is aggrandized beyond measure. The
      worthies kill the entire vanguard of the Saracens, a hundred thousand men,
      and, afterward, the army of King Marsile, thirty battalions, each composed
      of ten thousand men. Roland winds his horn, and the <span class="pagenum">[213]</span><a
      name="link213" id="link213"></a>sound travels away thirty leagues to
      Charlemagne, and is echoed by his sixty thousand hautboys. What visions
      such words awakened in those inexperienced brains! Then all at once the
      bow was unbent; the wounded Roland calls to mind &ldquo;men of his
      lineage, of gentle France, of Charlemagne his lord who supports him, and
      cannot help but weep and sigh for them.&rdquo; At the conclusion of the
      carnage with which they filled Jerusalem, the crusaders, weeping and
      chanting, went barefoot to the holy sepulchre. Later, when a number of the
      barons wanted to leave the crusade of Constantinople, the others went to
      meet them, and entreated them on their knees; then all embraced each
      other, bursting into sobs. Robust children: that expresses the whole
      truth; they killed and howled as if they were beasts of prey, then when
      once the fury was calmed, they were all tears and tenderness, like a child
      who flings himself upon his brother&rsquo;s neck, or who is going to make

      I return to my Béarnais; they were the most active and circumspect of the
      band. The counts of Bearn fought and treated with all the world; they
      hover between the patronage of France, Spain and England, and are subject
      to no <span class="pagenum">[214]</span><a name="link214" id="link214"></a>one;
      they pass from one to the other and always to their own advantage, &ldquo;drawn,&rdquo;
      says Matthew Paris, &ldquo;by pounds sterling, or crowns, of which they
      had both great need and great abundance.&rdquo; They are always first
      where fighting is to be done or money to be gained; they go to be killed
      in Spain or to demand gold at Poitiers. They are calculators and
      adventurers; from imagination and courage lovers of warfare,&mdash;lovers
      of necessity and reflection.

      And in this manner their Henry won the crown of France, thinking much of
      his interests and little of his life, and always poor. After the camp at
      La Fère, when he was already recognized as king, he wrote: &ldquo;I have
      only a pretence of a horse on which to fight, and no entire armor that I
      can put on; my shirts are in tatters, my pourpoints out at the elbows. My
      saucepan is many a time upset, and now these two days I have dined and
      supped with <span class="pagenum">[215]</span><a name="link215"
      id="link215"></a>one and another, for my purveyors say that they see no
      way of furnishing my table any longer, especially since they have received
      no money for six months.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A month later, at Fontaine-Française, he charged an army at the head of
      eight hundred cavaliers, and fired off his pistol by way of sport, like a
      soldier. But at the same time this father of his people treated the people
      in the following manner: &ldquo;The prisons of Normandy were full of
      prisoners for the payment of the duty on salt. They languished there in
      such wise that as many as six-score of their corpses were brought forth at
      one time. The parliament of Rouen besought His Majesty to have pity on his
      people; but the king had been told that a great revenue was coming from
      that tax, and said that he was willing that it should be raised, and
      seemed that he would wish to turn the rest into mockery.&rdquo;

      A good fellow, no doubt, but a devil of a good fellow; we French are fond
      of such; they are likable, but sometimes deserve hanging. These had
      prudence into the bargain, and were made to be officers of fortune. <span

      says Tallemant des Reaux, &ldquo;was the fourth of five sons. When he had
      finished his studies, he was sent to the war; but otherwise he was but
      poorly furnished. For his sole horse his father gave him a docked pony,
      that might have been thirty years old; its like was not in all Bearn, and
      it was called, as a rarity, <i>Gassion&rsquo;s Bob-tail.</i> Apparently
      the young man was scarcely better provided with money than with horses.
      This pretty courser left him four or five leagues from Pau, but that did
      not prevent him from going into Savoy, where he entered the troops of the
      duke, for there was then no war in France. But the late king having broken
      with this prince, all Frenchmen had orders to quit his service; this
      forced our adventurer to return to the service of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the taking of the pass of Suze, he did so well, although only a
      simple cavalier, that he was made cornet; but the company in which he was
      cornet was broken, and he came to Paris and asked for the mantle of a
      musketeer. He was refused on account of his religion. Out of spite, with
      several other Frenchmen he went over to Germany, and, although in his
      troop there were men of higher position than he, knowing how to talk in
      Latin, he was everywhere received for the chief of the band. One of these
      made the advances for a company of light-horse that they were going to
      <span class="pagenum">[217]</span><a name="link217" id="link217"></a>raise
      in France for the king of Sweden; he was lieutenant of it; his captain was
      killed, and now he is himself a captain. He soon made himself known as a
      man of spirit, so that he obtained from the king of Sweden the privilege
      of receiving orders only from His Majesty in person; this was on condition
      of marching always at the head of the army and of filling in a measure the
      position of forlorn hope. While thus employed, he received a frightful
      pistol-shot in the right side, the wound of which has since opened several
      times, now to the peril of his life, and now the opening answering as a
      crisis in other illnesses.&rdquo;

      He was a thorough soldier, and above all a lover of valor. A rebel
      peasant, at Avranches, fought admirably before a barricade, and killed the
      Marquis de Courtaumer, whom he took for Gassion. Gassion had search made
      everywhere for this gallant man, in order that he might be pardoned and to
      put him in his regiment. The Chancellor Séguier took the affair like a
      lawyer; some time after, having seized the peasant, he had him broken on
      the wheel. <span class="pagenum">[218]</span><a name="link218" id="link218"></a>He
      treated civil affairs just as he did military ones. He sent word to a
      merchant in Paris who had become bankrupt, owing him ten thousand livres,
      &ldquo;that it would not be possible for him to let remain in the world a
      man who was carrying away his property.&rdquo; He was paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He led men into war admirably. I have heard related an action of
      his, very bold and at the same time very sensible; before he was
      major-general, he asked several noblemen if they wished to join his party.
      They went with him. After having gone about the whole morning without
      finding anything, he said to them: &lsquo;We are too strong; the parties
      all fly before us. Let us leave here our horsemen, and go away alone.&rsquo;
      The volunteers followed him; they went on until they were near to
      Saint-Omer. Just then two squadrons of cavalry suddenly appeared and cut
      off their way; for Saint-Omer was behind our people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Messieurs,&rsquo; said he to them, &lsquo;we must pass or
      die. Put yourselves all abreast; ride full speed at them and don&rsquo;t
      fire. The first squadron will be afraid, when they see that you mean to
      fire only into their teeth; they will rein back and overthrow the others.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      It happened just as he had said: our noblemen, well mounted, forced the
      two squadrons and saved themselves, almost to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another, also very daring; which, however, <span class="pagenum">[219]</span><a
      name="link219" id="link219"></a>seems to me a little rash. Having received
      notice that the Croats were leading away the horses of the Prince d&rsquo;Enrichemont,
      he wanted to charge upon them, accompanied by only a few of his horsemen,
      and, as there happened to be a great ditch between him and the enemy, he
      swam across it on his horse, without looking to see if any one followed
      him, so that he encountered the enemy alone, killed five of them, put the
      rest to flight, and returned with three of our men whom they had taken,
      and who perhaps helped him in the struggle. He led back all the horses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The quondam light-horseman reappeared beneath the general&rsquo;s uniform.
      Thus he always remained the comrade of his soldiers. When any one had
      offended the least of his cavalrymen, he took the man with him and had
      satisfaction given in one way or another.

      He was a poor courtier and troubled himself little about ceremonies. One
      day he went to the communion before the prince palatine, and the following
      Sunday, having found his place taken, he would never allow that a nobleman
      should give it up, and went to seek a place somewhere else. Nevertheless
      he was scarcely courtly towards ladies, and on this point not at all
      worthy of Henry IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At court, many young ladies who were pleased with him, were
      wheedling him, and said: &lsquo;Of a <span class="pagenum">[221]</span><a
      name="link221" id="link221"></a>truth, monsieur, you have performed the
      finest possible deeds.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a matter of
      course,&rsquo; said he. When one said: &lsquo;I should be glad to have a
      husband like M. de Gassion.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rsquo;
      answered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said of Mlle, de Ségur, who was old and ugly, &lsquo;I like that
      young woman; she looks like a Croat.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Bougis, his <i>lieutenant de gendarmes</i>, stayed too long in
      Paris in the winter-time, he wrote to him: &lsquo;You are amusing yourself
      with those women, and you will die like a dog; here you would find fine
      chances. What the devil do you find in the way of pleasure in going to
      court and making love! That is pretty business in comparison with the
      pleasure of taking a quarter!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother, Bergerê, seems to have had little taste for this pleasure.
      Gassion, then a colonel, on one occasion ordered him to charge at the head
      of fifty cavaliers, and declared that if he gave way he would run him
      through the body with his sword. An admirable method for forming men!
      Bergerê found his account in it, and afterwards went into action like any
      other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two adventurers had a thoroughly military ending. Their brother the
      president, for economy&rsquo;s sake, had Bergerê embalmed by a valet de
      chambre who mangled him shockingly. As for Gassion, he awaited burial
      during three months. <span class="pagenum">[222]</span><a name="link222"
      id="link222"></a>"The president, tired of paying for the funeral hangings,
      had them returned, and others put up which cost him ten <i>sols</i> less a
      day. At last he had a small vault constructed between two gates in the old
      cemetery; he had them interred one day when there was a sermon without any
      solemnity whatever, and so that no one could say that he had gone there on
      their account.&rdquo; Three out of four heroes have been similarly buried,
      like dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of the d&rsquo;Artagnans, those heroic hunters after paying
      adventures, was (according to an inscription, said to be false) born at
      Pau, rue du Tran, No. 6. A drummer in 1792, he was in 1810 prince royal of
      Sweden. He had made his way, and along it he had lost his prejudices. Like
      Henry IV., he found that a kingdom was worth quite as much as a mass; he
      too made the perilous leap, but in a contrary direction, and laid aside
      his religion like an old cassock; a question of old clothes: a brand-new
      royal mantle was worth far more.

      Eaux-Bonnes at dawn. The sun is scarcely yet risen, and is still hidden by
      the mountains. Pale rays begin to color the mosses on the western
      declivity. These mosses, bathed in dew, seem as if awakening under the
      first caress of the day. Rosy hues, of an inexpressible softness, rest on
      the summits, then steal down along the slopes. One could never have
      believed that these gaunt old creatures were capable of an expression so
      timid and so tender. The light broadens, heaven expands, the air is filled
      with joy and life. A bald peak in the midst of the rest, and darker than
      they, stands out in an aureole of flame. All at once, <span class="pagenum">[226]</span><a

      Beyond Pau stretches a smiling country, golden with harvests, amongst
      which the Gave winds its blue folds between white and pebbly beaches. On
      the right, far away in a veil of luminous mist, the Pyrenees lift their
      jagged tops, and the naked points of their black rocks. Their flanks,
      furrowed by the torrents of winter, are deeply scored and, as it were,
      turned up with an iron rake.

      The picturesque country and the great mountains are seen to disclose
      themselves; the fences of the fields are of small rounded stones, in whose
      fissures abound waving grasses, pretty heaths, tufts of yellow sedum, and

      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Coarraze still preserves a tower and gateway, the remains of a castle.
      This castle has its legend, which Froissart recounts in a style so flowing
      and agreeable, so minute and expressive, that I cannot refrain from
      quoting it at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord of Coarraze had a dispute with a clerk, and the clerk left him
      with threats. About three months after, when the knight least thought of
      it, and was sleeping in his bed with his lady, in his castle of Coarraze,
      there came invisible messengers, who made such a noise, knocking about
      everything they met with in the castle, as if they were determined to
      destroy all within it: and they gave such loud raps at the door of the
      chamber of the knight, that the lady was exceedingly frightened. The
      knight heard it all, but did not say a word, as he would not have it
      appear that he was alarmed, for he was a man of sufficient courage for any
      adventure. These noises and tumults continued, in <span class="pagenum">[228]</span><a
      name="link228" id="link228"></a>different parts of the castle, for a
      considerable time, and then ceased. On the morrow, all the servants of the
      household assembled, and went to their lord,&rsquo; and said, &lsquo;My
      lord, did you not hear what we all heard this night?&rsquo; The Lord de
      Coarraze dissembled, and replied, &lsquo;What is it you have heard?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>
      They then related to him all the noises and rioting they had heard, and
      that the plates in the kitchen had been broken. He began to laugh, and
      said, &lsquo;It was nothing, that they had dreamed it, or that it had been
      the wind.&rsquo; &lsquo;In the name of God,&rsquo; added the lady, &lsquo;I
      well heard it.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[229]</span><a name="link229"
      id="link229"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the following night the noises and rioting were renewed, but
      much louder than before, and there were such blows struck against the door
      and windows of the chamber of the knight, that it seemed they would break
      them down. The knight could no longer desist from leaping out of his bed,
      and calling out, &lsquo;Who is it that at this hour thus knocks at my
      chamber door?&rsquo; He was instantly answered, &lsquo;It is I.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;And who sends thee hither?&rsquo; asked the knight. &lsquo;The
      clerk of Catalonia, whom thou hast much wronged; for thou hast deprived
      him of the rights of his benefice; I will, therefore, never leave thee
      quiet, until thou hast rendered him a just account, with which he shall be
      contented.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What art thou called,&rsquo; said the
      knight, 'who art so good a messenger?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;My name is
      Orthon.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Orthon,&rsquo; said the knight, &lsquo;serving
      a clerk will not be of much advantage to thee; for if thou believest him
      he will give thee great trouble: I beg thou wilt therefore leave him and
      serve me, and I shall think myself obliged to thee.&rsquo; Orthon was
      ready with his answer, for he had taken a liking to the knight, and said,
      &lsquo;Do you wish it?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the knight;
      &lsquo;but no harm must be done to any one within these walls.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh,
      no,&rsquo; answered Orthon; &lsquo;I have no power to do ill to any one,
      only to awaken thee and disturb thy rest, or that of other persons.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Do
      what I tell<span class="pagenum">[230]</span><a name="link230" id="link230"></a>
      thee,&rsquo; added the knight, &lsquo;we shall well agree, and leave this
      wicked priest, for he is a worthless fellow, and serve me.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
      replied Orthon, &lsquo;since thou wilt have it so, I consent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orthon took such an affection to the Lord de Coarraze, that he came
      often to see him in the night-time, and when he found him sleeping, he
      pulled his pillow from under his head, or made great noises at the door or
      windows; so that when the knight was awakened, he said, &lsquo;Orthon, let
      me sleep.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;until
      I have told thee some news.&rsquo; The knight&rsquo;s lady was so much
      frightened, the hairs of her head stood on end, and she hid herself under
      the bed-clothes. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the knight, &lsquo;and what news
      hast thou brought me?&rsquo; Orthon replied, &lsquo;I am come from
      England, Hungary, or some other place, which I left yesterday, and such
      and such things have happened.&rsquo; Thus did the Lord de Coarraze know
      by means of Orthon all things that were passing in different parts of the
      world; and this connection continued for five years; but he could not keep
      it to himself, and discovered it to the Count de Foix, in the manner I
      will tell you. The first year, the Lord de Coarraze came to the Count de
      Foix, at Orthès, or elsewhere, and told him, &lsquo;My lord, such an event
      has happened in England, in Scotland, Germany, or some other country,&rsquo;
      and the Count <span class="pagenum">[231]</span><a name="link231"
      id="link231"></a>de Foix, who found all this intelligence prove true,
      marvelled greatly how he could have acquired such early information, and
      entreated him so earnestly, that the Lord de Coarraze told him the means
      by which he had acquired his intelligence, and the manner of its
      communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the Count de Foix heard this, he was much pleased, and said,
      &lsquo;Lord de Coarraze, nourish the love of your intelligencer. I wish I
      had such a messenger; he costs you nothing, and you are truly informed of
      everything that passes in the world.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;My lord,&rsquo;
      replied the knight, &lsquo;I will do so.&rsquo; The Lord de Coarraze was
      served by Orthon for a long time. I am ignorant if Orthon had more than
      one master; but two or three times every week he visited the knight and
      told him all the news of the countries he had frequented, which he wrote
      immediately to the Count de Foix, who was much delighted therewith, as
      there is not a lord in the world more eager after news from foreign parts
      than he is. Once, when the Lord de Coarraze was in conversation on this
      subject with the Count de Foix, the Count said, &lsquo;Lord de Coarraze,
      have you never yet seen your messenger?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No, by my
      faith, never, nor have I ever pressed him on this matter.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I
      wonder at that,&rsquo; replied the count, &lsquo;for had he been so much
      attached to me, I should have begged of him to have shown himself in his
      <span class="pagenum">[232]</span><a name="link232" id="link232"></a>own
      proper form; and I entreat you will do so, that you may tell how he is
      made, and what he is like. You have said that he speaks Gascon as well as
      you or I do.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;By my faith,&rsquo; said the Lord de
      Coar-raze, &lsquo;he converses just as well and as properly, and, since
      you request it, I will do all I can to see him.&rsquo; It fell out when
      the Lord de Coarraze, as usual, was in bed with his lady (who was now
      accustomed to hear Orthon without being frightened), Orthon arrived and
      shook the pillow of the knight, who was asleep. On waking, he asked who
      was there. Orthon replied, &lsquo;It is I.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And where
      dost thou come from?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I come from Prague, in Bohemia.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;How
      far is it hence?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Sixty days&rsquo; journey,&rsquo;
      replied Orthon. &lsquo;And hast thou returned thence in so short a time?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes,
      as may God help me: I travel as fast as the wind, or faster.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What,
      hast thou got wings?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, no.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;How,
      then, canst thou fly so fast?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That is no business of
      yours.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No!&rsquo; said the knight. &lsquo;I should
      like exceedingly to see what form thou hast, and how thou art made.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That
      does not concern you to know,&rsquo; replied Orthon; &lsquo;be satisfied
      that you hear me, and that I bring you intelligence you may depend on.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;By
      God,&rsquo; said the Lord de Coarraze, &lsquo;I should love thee better if
      I had seen thee.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied Orthon, &lsquo;since
      you have such a desire, the first thing you shall see <span class="pagenum">[233]</span><a
      name="link233" id="link233"></a>tomorrow morning, in quitting your bed,
      shall be myself.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I am satisfied,&rsquo; said the
      knight; &lsquo;you may now depart; I give thee thy liberty for this night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When morning came, the knight arose, but his lady was so much
      frightened she pretended to be sick, and said she would not leave her bed
      the whole day. The Lord de Coarraze willed it otherwise. &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo;
      said she, &lsquo;if I do get up, I shall see Orthon; and, if it please
      God, I would neither see nor meet him.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
      replied the knight, &lsquo;I am determined to see him;&rsquo; and leaping
      out of his bed, he seated himself on the bedstead, thinking he should see
      Orthon in his own shape; but he saw nothing that could induce him to say
      he had seen him. When the ensuing night arrived, and the Lord de Coarraze
      was in bed, Orthon came and began to talk in his usual manner. 'Go,&rsquo;
      said the knight; &lsquo;thou art a liar. Thou oughtest to have shown
      thyself to me this morning, and hast not done so.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No!&rsquo;
      replied Orthon; &lsquo;but I have.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I say, no.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And
      did you see nothing at all when you leaped out of bed?&rsquo; The Lord de
      Coarraze was silent, and, having considered awhile, said, &lsquo;Yes; when
      sitting on my bedside, and thinking of thee, I saw two straws which were
      turning and playing together on the floor.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That was
      myself,&rsquo; replied Orthon, &lsquo;for I had taken that form.&rsquo;
      The Lord de Coarraze said, &lsquo;That will not <span class="pagenum">[234]</span><a
      name="link234" id="link234"></a>satisfy me; I beg of thee to assume some
      other shape, so that I may see thee and know thee.&rsquo; Orthon answered,
      &lsquo;You ask so much that you will ruin me and force me away from you,
      for your requests are too great.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;You shall not quit
      me,&rsquo; said the Lord de Coarraze; &lsquo;if I had once seen thee, I
      should not again wish it.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied Orthon,
      &lsquo;you shall see me to-morrow, if you pay attention to the first thing
      you observe when you leave your chamber.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I am
      contented,&rsquo; said the knight; &lsquo;now go thy ways, for I want to
      sleep.&rsquo; Orthon departed.

      &ldquo;On the morrow, about the hour of eight, the knight had risen and
      was dressed; on leaving his apartment, he went to a window which looked
      into the court of the castle. Casting his eyes about, the first thing he
      observed was an immensely large sow, but she <span class="pagenum">[235]</span><a
      name="link235" id="link235"></a>was so poor, she seemed only skin and
      bone, with long hanging ears all spotted, and a sharp-pointed, lean snout.
      The Lord de Coarraze was disgusted at such a sight, and, calling to his
      servants, said, &lsquo;Let the dogs loose quickly, for I will have that
      sow killed and devoured.&rsquo; The servants hastened to open the kennel,
      and to set the hounds on the sow, who uttered a loud cry and looked up at
      the Lord de Coarraze, leaning on the balcony of his window, and was never
      seen afterwards; for she vanished, and no one ever knew what became of
      her.

      &ldquo;The knight returned quite pensive to his chamber, for he then
      recollected what Orthon had told him, and said: &lsquo;I believe I have
      seen my messenger Orthon, and repent having set my hounds on him, for
      perhaps I may never see him more: he frequently told me, that if I ever
      angered him, I should lose him.&rsquo; He kept his word; for never did he
      return to the hôtel de Coarraze, and the knight died the following year.&rdquo;
      <span class="pagenum">[236]</span><a name="link236" id="link236"></a>This
      Orthon, the familiar spirits, queen Mab, are the poor little popular gods,
      children of the pool and the oak, engendered by the melancholy and
      awe-struck reveries of the spinning maiden and the peasant. A great state
      religion then overshadowed all thoughts; doctrine ready-made was imposed
      upon them; men could no longer, as in Greece or Scandinavia, build the
      great poem which suited their manners and mind. They received it from
      above, and repeated the litany with docility, yet not very well
      understanding it. Their invention produced only legends of saints or
      churchyard superstitions. Since they could not reach God, they struck out
      for themselves goblins, hermits, and gnomes, and by these simple and
      fantastic figures they expressed their rustic life or their vague terrors.
      This Orthon, who storms at the door in the night and breaks the dishes, is
      he anything more than the night-mare of a half-wakened man, anxiously
      listening to the rustling of the wind that fumbles at the doors, and the
      sudden noises of the night magnified by silence! The child in his bed
      suffers similar fears when he covers eyes and ears that he may not see the
      strange shadow of the wardrobe, or hear the stifled cries of the thatch on
      the roof. The two straws that play convulsively on the floor, twined
      together like twins, and shine with mysterious brilliancy in the <span

      In this way is born the race of familiars and fairies, nimble creatures,
      swift travellers, as capricious and sudden as a dream, who amuse
      themselves maliciously in sticking together the manes of the horses, or in
      souring the milk, yet sometimes become tender and domesticated, attached
      like the cricket to its hearthstone, and are the penates of the country
      and the farm, invisible and powerful as gods, quaint and odd as children.

      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We no sooner reach Lestelle, than we are assured on all sides that we must
      visit the chapel. We pass between rows of shops full of rosaries, basins
      for holy-water, medals, small crucifixes, through a cross-fire of offers,
      exhortations and cries. After which we are free to admire the edifice, a
      liberty which we are careful not to abuse. On the portal, indeed, there is
      a pretty enough virgin in the style of the seventeenth century, four
      evangelists in marble, and in the interior several tolerable pictures; but
      the blue dome starred with gold looks like a bonbonnière, the walls are
      disgraced with engravings from the rue Saint-Jacques, the altar is loaded
      with gewgaws. The gilded den is pretentious and gloomy; for such a
      beautiful country the good God seems but ill harbored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor little chapel nestles close to a huge mountain wooded with
      crowded green thickets, which stretches out superbly in the light, and
      warms its belly in the sun. The highway is abruptly checked, makes a curve
      and crosses the Gave. The pretty bridge of a single arch rests its feet
      upon the naked rock and trails its ivy drapery in the blue-green eddies of
      the stream. We ascend beautiful wooded hills where the cows are grazing,
      and whose rounded slopes dip gently <span class="pagenum">[242]</span><a
      name="link242" id="link242"></a>down to the river&rsquo;s brink. We are
      nearing Saint Pé, on the confines of Bigorre and Beam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Pe contains a curious Roman church writh sculptured doorway. A
      luminous dust was dancing in its warm shadows; the eyes penetrated with
      pleasure into the depths of the background; its reliefs seemed to swim in
      a living blackness. All at once comes a clatter of cracking whips, of
      rolling and grinding wheels, of hoofs that strike fire from the pavement;
      then the endless hedge of white walls running away to the right and the
      left, flecked with glaring lights; then the sudden opening of the heavens
      and the triumph of the sun, whose furnace blazes in the remotest depths of
      the air.

      Near Lourdes, the hills became bald and the landscape sad. Lourdes is only
      a mass of dull, lead-colored roofs, heaped up below the highway. <span

      <span class="pagenum">[245]</span><a name="link245" id="link245"></a>The
      two small towers of the fort outline their slender forms against the sky.
      A single enormous, blackish rock lifts its back, corroded by mosses, above
      the enclosure of a slight wall that winds to shut it in, and suggests an
      elephant in a boarded shed. The neighborhood of the mountains dwarfs all
      human constructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy clouds rose in the sky, and the dull horizon became encased between
      two rows of mountains, gaunt, patched with scant brushwood, cleft in
      ravines; a pale light fell on the mutilated summits and into the gray
      crevices. Bands of beggars, in relays, hooked themselves on to the
      carriage with hoarse inarticulate noises, with idiotic air, wry necks, and
      deformed bodies; the projecting sinews swelled the wrinkled skin, and,
      peeping through the rags and tatters, was seen the flesh, in color like a
      burned brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered the gorge of Pierrefitte. The clouds had spread, and darkened
      the whole heaven; the wind swept along in sudden gusts and whipped the
      dust into whirlwinds. The carriage rolled on between two immense walls of
      dark rocks, slashed and notched as if by the axe of an infuriate giant;
      rugged furrows, seamed with yawning gashes, reddish wounds, torn and
      crossed by pallid wounds, scar upon scar; the perpendicular <span
      class="pagenum">[246]</span><a name="link246" id="link246"></a>flank still
      bleeds from multiplied blows. Half-detached, bluish masses hung in sharp
      points over our heads; a thousand feet higher up, layers of blocks leaned
      forward, overhanging the way. At a prodigious height, the black,
      battlemented summits pierced the vapors, while, with every step forward,
      it seemed as if the narrow passage were coming to an end. The darkness was
      growing, and, under that livid light with its threatening reflexes, it
      seemed that those beetling monsters were shaking and would soon engulf
      everything. The trees, beaten against the rock, were bending and twisting.
      The wind complained with a long-drawn piercing moan, and beneath its
      mournful sound, the hoarse rumbling of the Gave was heard as it dashed
      madly against the rocks it could not subdue, and moaned sadly like a
      stricken soul that rebels against the torments it is powerless to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain came and covered all objects with its blinding veil. An hour
      later, the drained clouds were creeping along half way up the height; the
      dripping rocks shone through a dark varnish, like blocks of polished
      mahogany. Turbid water went boiling down the swollen cascades; the depths
      of the gorge were still darkened by the storm; but a tender light played
      over the wet summits, like a smile bathed in tears. The gorge opened up;
      the <span class="pagenum">[247]</span><a name="link247" id="link247"></a>
      arches of the marble bridges sprang lightly into the limpid air, and,
      sheeted in light, Luz was seen seated among sparkling meadows and fields
      of millet in full bloom.

      CHAPTER II. LUZ.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>uz is a little
      city, thoroughly rustic and agreeable. Streams of water run down the
      narrow, flinty streets; the gray houses press together for the sake of
      gaining a little shade. The morning sees the arrival of flocks of sheep,
      of asses laden with wood, of grunting and undisciplined hogs, and
      bare-footed peasant girls, knitting as they walk alongside of their carts.
      Luz is in a spot where four valleys come together. Men and beasts
      disappear on the market-place; red umbrellas are fixed in the ground. The
      women seat themselves alongside their wares; around them their red-cheeked
      brats are nibbling their bread, and frisking like so <span class="pagenum">[251]</span><a
      name="link251" id="link251"></a>many mice; provisions are sold, stuffs are
      bought. At noon the streets are deserted; here and there in the shadow of
      a doorway may be discerned the figure of an old woman sitting, but no
      sound is heard save the gentle murmur of the streams along their stony
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faces here are pretty: the children are a pleasure to look upon,
      before toil and the sun have spoiled their features. They amble merrily
      through the dust, and turn toward the passer their bright round faces,
      their speaking eyes, with slight and abrupt movements. When the girls,
      with their red petticoats tucked up, and in capulets of thick red stuff,
      approach to ask alms of you, you see under the crude color the pure oval
      of a clear-cut, proud countenance, a soft, almost pale hue, and the sweet
      look of two great tranquil eyes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.

    <p>
      The church is cool and solitary; it once belonged to the Templars. These
      monk-soldiers obtained a foothold in the most out-of-the-way corners of
      Europe. The tower is square as a fortress; the enclosing wall has
      battlements like a fortified city. The dark old door-way would be easily
      defended. Upon its arch, which is very low, may be distinguished a
      half-obliterated Christ, and two fantastic, <span class="pagenum">[252]</span><a
      name="link252" id="link252"></a>rudely colored birds. As you enter, a
      small uncovered tomb serves as font, and you are shown a low door through
      which passed the accursed race of the <i>bigots.</i> * Its first aspect is
      singular, but has nothing unpleasant about it. A good woman in a red
      capulet, knitting in hand, was praying near a confessional of badly planed
      boards, under an old brown gallery of turned wood. Poverty and antiquity
      are never ugly, and this expression of religious care seemed to suit well
      with the ruins and souvenirs of the middle ages scattered about us.

<pre xml:space="preserve">

with Cretinism.&mdash;Translator.
</pre>
    <p>
      But deeply rooted in the people is a certain indefinable love of the
      ridiculous and absurd which succeeds in spoiling everything; in this poor
      church, tracery, from which the gilding is worn away, crosses a vault of
      scoured azure with tarnished stars, flames, roses and little cherubs with
      wings for cravats. A brownish pink angel, suspended by one foot, flies
      forward, bearing in its hand a golden crown. In the opposite aisle may be
      seen the face of the sun, with puffy cheeks, semicircular eyebrows, and
      looking as sapient as in an almanac. The altar is loaded with a profusion
      of tarnished gilding, sallow angels, with simple and piteous faces like
      those of children who have eaten too much dinner. All this shows that
      their huts are very dreary, naked and dull.<span class="pagenum">[253]</span><a

      A people that has just emerged from the dirt is apt to love gilding. The
      most insipid sweetmeat is delicious to one who has long eaten nothing but
      roots and dry bread.

    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Luz was formerly the capital of these valleys, which formed together a
      sort of republic; each commune deliberated upon its own private interests;
      four or five villages formed a <i>vic</i> and the deputies from every four
      vics assembled at Luz.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list of the assessments was, from time immemorial, made upon bits of
      wood called <i>totchoux,</i> that is to say, sticks. Each community had
      its <i>totchoti,</i> upon which the secretary cut with his knife Roman
      ciphers, the value of which was known only to himself. In 1784 the
      intendant of Auch, who knew nothing of this custom, ordered of the
      government officials to bring to him the ancient registers; the official
      came, followed by two cartloads of totchoux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor country, free country. The estates of Bigorre were composed of three
      chambers which deliberated separately; that of the clergy, that of the
      nobility, and the third estate, made up of consuls or principal officers
      of the communes, and deputies <span class="pagenum">[256]</span><a
      name="link256" id="link256"></a>from the valleys. In these assemblies the
      taxes were apportioned, and all important matters were discussed. A valley
      is a natural fortified city, defended against the outside world and
      stimulating association. The enemy could be arrested on his way, and
      crushed beneath the rocks; in winter, the torrents and the snow shut him
      off from all entrance. Could knights in armor pursue the herdsman into his
      bogs? What could they have taken as prisoners, except a few half-starved
      goats? The daring climbers, hunters of the bear and wolf, would willingly
      have played at this game, sure of winning at it warm clothes, arms and
      horses. It is thus that independence has lasted in Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Free country, poor country. I have already remarked that in the valley of
      Ossau. The plains are mere defiles between the feet of two chains.
      Cultivation climbs the slope, wherever it is not too steep. If a morsel of
      earth exists between two rocks, it is put to seed. Man gets from the
      desert as much as he can wrest from it: so terraces of fields and harvests
      mottle the declivity with green strips and yellow squares. Barns and
      stables sprinkle it with white patches; it is streaked by a long grayish
      footpath. But this robe, torn by jutting rocks as it is, stops short
      half-way up, and the summit is clothed only with barren moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harvest is gathered in July, without horses, <span class="pagenum">[257]</span><a
      name="link257" id="link257"></a>of course, or carts. On these slopes, man
      alone can perform the service of a horse: the sheaves are enclosed in
      great pieces of cloth and fastened with cords; the reaper takes the
      enormous bundle upon his head, and ascends with naked feet among the
      sharp-pointed stalks and stones, without ever making a false step.

    <p>
      You find here ordinances reducing by half the number of men-at-arms
      required of the country, founded upon the proportion of harvests destroyed
      each year by hail and frost. Several times, during the religious wars, the
      country became a desert. In 1575, Montluc declares &ldquo;that it is now
      so poor that the dwellers hereabouts are forced to quit their houses and
      take to begging.&rdquo; In 1592, the <span class="pagenum">[258]</span><a
      name="link258" id="link258"></a>people of Comminge having devastated the
      country, &ldquo;the peasants of Bigorre abandoned the culture of the land
      for want of cattle, and the greater part of them took the road into Spain.&rdquo;
      It is not a hundred years since that, in all the country, there, were
      known to exist but three hats and two pairs of shoes. To this very day,
      the mountaineers are forced to renew with every year their sloping fields,
      wasted by the rains of winter. &ldquo;They burn, for light, bits of
      resinous pine, and scarcely ever taste meat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What misery is contained in those few words! Yet how deep must be the
      wretchedness that can break the tie that binds man to his native soil! A
      threadbare text from history, a phrase of passionless statistics, contain
      within their limits years of suffering, myriads of deaths, flight,
      separations, degradation. Of a truth, there is too much ill in the world.
      With every century, man removes a bramble and a stone that had helped to
      obstruct the way over which he advances; but what signifies a bramble or a
      stone? There remain, and always will remain, more than enough to lacerate
      and kill him. Besides, new flints are falling into the way, new thorns are
      springing up. Prosperity increases his sensibility: an equal pain is
      inflicted by a less evil; the body may be better shielded, but the soul is
      more disordered. <span class="pagenum">[259]</span><a name="link259"

      This valley is everywhere refreshed and made, fertile by running water. On
      the road to Pierrefitte two swift streams prattle under the shade of the
      flowering hedges: no travelling companion could be gayer. On both sides,
      from every meadow, flow streamlets that cross each other, separate, come
      together, and finally together spring into the Gave. In this way the
      peasants water all their crops; a field has five or six lines of streams
      which run hemmed in by beds of slate. The bounding troop tosses itself in
      the sunlight, like a madcap band of boys just let loose from school. The
      turf that they nourish is of an incomparable freshness and vigor; the
      herbage grows thick along the brink, bathes its feet in the water, or lies
      under the rush of the little waves, and its ribbons tremble in a pearly
      reflection under the ripples of silver. You cannot walk ten steps without
      stumbling upon a waterfall; swollen and boiling cascades pour down upon
      great blocks of stone; transparent sheets stretch themselves over the
      rocky shelves; threadlike streaks of foam wind from the verge to the very
      valley; springs ooze out alongside the hanging grasses and fall drop by
      drop; on the right rolls the Gave, and drowns all these murmurs with <span
      class="pagenum">[263]</span><a name="link263" id="link263"></a>its great
      monotonous voice. The beautiful blue iris thrives along the marshy slopes;
      woods and Crops climb very high among the rocks. The valley smiles,
      encircled with verdure; but on the horizon the embattled peaks, the
      serrate crests and black escarpments of the notched mountains rise into
      the blue sky, beneath their mantle of snow.

      Back of Luz is a bare, rounded eminence, called Saint-Pierre, crowned by a
      fragment of gray ruin, and commanding a view of the whole valley. When the
      sky has been overcast, I have spent here entire hours without a moment of
      weariness: beneath its cloudy Curtain the air is moderately warm. Sudden
      patches of sunlight stripe the Gave, or illumine the harvests hung midway
      on the mountain slope. The swallows, with shrill cries, wheel high in the
      creeping vapors; the <span class="pagenum">[264]</span><a name="link264"
      id="link264"></a>sound of the Gave comes up, softened by distance into a
      harmony that is almost aerial. The wind breathes, and dies away; a troop
      of little flowers flutters at the passage of its wing; the buttercups are
      drawn up in line; frail little pinks bury in the herbage their rosy-purple
      stars; slender-stemmed grasses nod over the broad slaty patches; the air
      is filled with the fragrance of thyme. Are they not happy, these solitary
      plants, watered by the dew, fanned by the breezes?

      This height is a desert; no one comes to tread them down; they grow after
      their own sweet will, in clefts of the rock, by families, useless and
      free, flooded by the loveliest sunlight. And man, the slave of necessity,
      begs and calculates under penalty of his life! Three children, all in

      CHAPTER III. SAUVT-SAUVEUR.&mdash;BARÉGES.

    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>aint-Sauveur is a
      sloping street, both pretty and regular, bearing no trace of the
      extemporized hotel or of the scenery of an opera, and without either the
      rustic roughness of a village or the tarnished elegance of a city. The
      houses extend without monotony, their lines of windows encased in
      rough-hewn marble: on the right, they are set back to back against pointed
      rocks, from which water oozes; on the left they overhang the Gave, which
      eddies at the bottom of the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bath-house is a square portico with a double row of columns, in style
      at once noble and simple; the blue-gray of the marble, neither dull nor
      glaring, is pleasing to the eye. A terrace <span class="pagenum">[267]</span><a
      name="link267" id="link267"></a>planted with lindens projects over the
      Gave, and receives the cool breezes that rise from the torrent toward the
      heights; these lindens fill the air with a delicate and agreeable perfume.
      At the foot of the breast-high wall, the water of the spring shoots forth
      in a white jet and falls between the tree-tops into a depth unfathomable
      by the eye.

    </h4>
    <p>
      At the end of the village, the winding paths of an English garden descend
      to the Gave; you cross its dull blue waters on a frail wooden bridge, and
      <span class="pagenum">[268]</span><a name="link268" id="link268"></a>mount
      again, skirting a field of millet as far as the road to Scia. The side of
      this road plunges down six hundred feet, streaked with ravines; at the
      bottom of the abyss, the Gave writhes in a rocky corridor that the
      noon-day sun scarce penetrates; the slope is so rapid that, in several
      places, the stream is invisible; the precipice is so deep that the roar
      reaches the ear like a murmur. The torrent is lost to sight under the
      cornices and boils in the caverns; at every step it whitens with foam the
      smooth stone. Its restless ways, its mad leaps, its dark and livid
      reflexes, suggest a serpent wounded and covered with foam. But the
      strangest spectacle of all is that of the wall of rocks opposite: the
      mountain has been cleft perpendicularly as if by an immense sword, and one
      would say that the first gash had been further mutilated by hands, weaker,
      yet still infuriate. From the summit down to the Gave, the rock is of the
      color of dead wood, stripped of the bark; the prodigious tree-trunk, slit
      and jagged, seems mouldering away there through the centuries; water oozes
      in the blackened rents as in those of a worm-eaten block; it is yellowed
      by mosses such as vegetate in the rottenness of humid oaks. Its wounds
      have the brown and veined hues that one sees in the old scars of trees. It
      is in truth a petrified beam, a relic of Babel. <span class="pagenum">[269]</span><a
      name="link269" id="link269"></a>The geologists are a fortunate race; they
      express all this, and many things besides, when they say that the rock is
      schistose.
    </p>
    <p>
      After going a league we found a bit of meadow, two or three cottages
      situated upon the gentle slope. The contrast is refreshing. And yet the
      pasturage is meagre, studded with barren rocks, surrounded with fallen
      debris; if it were not for a rivulet of ice-cold water, the sun would
      scorch the herbage. Two children were sleeping under a walnut tree; a goat
      that had climbed upon a rock was bleating plaintively and tremblingly;
      three or four hens, with curious and uneasy air, were scratching on the
      brink of a trench; a woman was drawing water from the spring with a wooden
      porringer: such is the entire wealth of these poor households. Sometimes
      they have, four or five hundred feet higher up, a field of barley, so
      steep that the reaper must be fastened by a rope in order to harvest it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Gave is strewn with small islands, which may be reached by jumping
      from one stone to another. These islands are beds of bluish rock spotted
      with pebbles of a staring white; they are submerged in winter, and now
      there are trunks stripped of their bark still lying here and there <span
      class="pagenum">[270]</span><a name="link270" id="link270"></a>among the
      bowlders. In some hollows are remains of ooze; from these spring clusters
      of elms like a discharge of fireworks, and tufts of grass wave over the
      arid pebbles; around the hushed water grows warm in the caverns. Meanwhile
      on two sides the mountain lifts its reddish wall, streaked with foam by
      the streamlets that wind down over the surface. Over all the flanks of the
      island the cascades rumble like thunder; twenty ravines, one above
      another, engulf them in their chasms, and their roar comes from all sides
      like the din of a battle. A mist flashes back and floats above all this
      storm: it hangs among the trees and opposes&rsquo; its fine cool gauze to
      the burning of the sun.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In clear weather I have often climbed the mountain before sunrise. During
      the night, the mist of the Gave, accumulated in the gorges, has filled
      them to overflowing; under foot there is a sea of clouds, and overhead a
      dome of tender blue radiant with morning splendor; everything else has
      disappeared; nothing is to be seen but the luminous azure of heaven and
      the dazzling satin of the clouds; nature wears her vesture of purity. The
      eye glides with pleasure over the softly rounded forms of the aerial mass.

      its bosom the crests stand forth like promontories; the mountain tops that
      it bathes rise like an archipelago of rocks; it buries itself in the
      jagged gulfs, and waves slowly around the peaks that it gains. The
      harshness of the bald crests heightens the grace of its ravishing
      whiteness. But it evaporates as it rises; already the landscapes of the
      depths appear under a transparent twilight; the middle of the valley
      discovers itself. There remains of the floating sea only a white girdle,
      which trails along the declivities; it becomes torn, and the shreds hang
      for a moment to the tops of the trees; the last tufts take flight, and the
      Gave, struck by the sun glitters around the mountain like a necklace of
      diamonds.

    <p>
      Paul and I have gone to Bareges; the road is a continual ascent for two
      leagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alley of trees stretches between a brook and the Gave. The water leaps
      from every height; here and there a crowd of little mills is perched over
      the cascades; the declivities are sprinkled with them. It is amusing to
      see the little things nestled in the hollows of the colossal slopes. And
      yet their slated roofs smile and gleam among the foliage. There is nothing
      here that is not gracious and lovely; the banks of the Gave preserve their
      freshness <span class="pagenum">[274]</span><a name="link274" id="link274"></a>under
      the burning sun; the small streams scarcely leave between themselves and
      it a narrow band of green; one is surrounded by running waters; the shadow
      of the ashes and alders trembles in the fine grass; the trees shoot up
      with a superb toss, in smooth columns, and only spread forth in branches
      at a height of forty feet. The dark water in the trench of slate grazes
      the green stems in its course; it runs so swiftly that it seems to shiver.

      On the opposite side of the torrent, the poplars rise one above another on
      the verdant hill; their palish leaves stand out against the pure blue of
      the sky; they quiver and shine at the slightest wind. <span class="pagenum">[275]</span><a
      name="link275" id="link275"></a>Flowering brambles descend the length of
      the rock and reach the tips of the waves. Further off, the back of the
      mountain, loaded with brushwood, stretches out in a warm tint of dark
      blue. The distant woods sleep in this envelope of living moisture, and the
      earth impregnated by it seems to inhale with it force and pleasure.

    <p>
      Soon the mountains grow bald, the trees disappear; nothing upon the slopes
      but a poor <span class="pagenum">[276]</span><a name="link276" id="link276"></a>brushwood:
      Bareges is seen. The landscape is hideous. The flank of the mountain is
      creviced with whitish slides; the narrow and wasted plain disappears
      beneath the coarse sand; the poor herbage, dry and weighed down, fails at
      every step; the earth is as if ripped open, and the slough, through its
      yawning wound, exposes the very entrails; the beds of yellowish limestone
      are laid bare; one walks on sands and trains of rounded pebbles; the Gave
      itself half disappears under heaps of grayish stones, and with difficulty
      gets out of the desert it has made. This broken-up soil is as ugly as it
      is melancholy; the debris are dirty and mean; they date from yesterday;
      you feel that the devastation begins anew with every year. Ruins, in order
      to be beautiful, must be either grand or blackened by time; here, the
      stones have just been unearthed, they are still soaking in the mud; two
      miry streamlets creep through the gullies: the place reminds one of an
      abandoned quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town of Bareges is as ugly as its avenue; melancholy houses, ill
      patched up; at some distance apart are long rows of booths and wooden
      huts, where handkerchiefs and poor ironmongery are sold. It is because the
      avalanche accumulates every winter in a mountain crevice on the left, and
      as it slides down carries off a side of the street; these booths are a
      scar. The cold mists collect <span class="pagenum">[277]</span><a
      name="link277" id="link277"></a>here, the wind penetrates and the little
      town is uninhabitable in winter.

      The around is enshrouded un der fifteen feet of snow; all the inhabitants
      emigrate; seven or eight mountaineers are left here with provisions, to
      watch over the houses and the furniture. It often happens that these poor
      people cannot get as far as Luz, and remain imprisoned during several
      weeks.

    <p>
      The bathing establishment is miserable, the compartments are cellars
      without air or light; there are only sixteen cabinets, all dilapidated.
      Invalids are often obliged to bathe at night. The three pools are fed by
      water which has just served for the bathing-tubs; that for the poor
      receives the water discharged from the other two. <span class="pagenum">[278]</span><a
      name="link278" id="link278"></a>These pools, <i>piscines,</i> are low and
      dark, a sort of stifling, under-ground prison. One must have pretty good

      The military hospital, banished to the north of the little town, is a
      melancholy plastered building, whose windows are ranged in rows with
      military regularity. The invalids, wrapped in a gray cloak too large for
      them, climb one by one the naked slope, and seat themselves among the
      stones; they bask whole hours in the sun, and look straight before them
      with a resigned air. An invalid&rsquo;s days are so long! These wasted
      faces resume an air of <span class="pagenum">[279]</span><a name="link279"
      id="link279"></a>gayety when a comrade passes; they exchange a jest: even
      in a hospital, at Bareges even, a Frenchman remains a Frenchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      You meet poor old men on crutches, invalids, climbing the steep street.
      Those visages reddened by the inclement air, those pitiful bent or twisted
      limbs, the swollen or enfeebled flesh, the dull eyes, already dead, are
      painful to behold. At their age, habituated to misery, they ought to feel
      only the suffering of the moment, not to trouble themselves about the
      past, and no longer to care for the future. You need to think that their
      torpid soul lives on like a machine. They are the ruins of man alongside
      those of the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of the west is still more sombre. An enormous mass of blackish
      and snowy peaks girdles the horizon. They are hung over the valley like an
      eternal threat. Those spines so rugged, so manifold, so angular, give to
      the eye the sensation of an invincible hardness. There comes from them a
      cold wind, that drives heavy clouds towards Bareges; nothing is gay but
      the two jewelled streamlets which border the street and prattle noisily
      over the blue pebbles.

      In order to console ourselves here, we have read some charming letters;
      here is one of them from the little Duc du Maine, seven years old, whom
      Mme. de Maintenon had brought here to be cured. He wrote to his mother
      Mme. de Montespan, and the letter must certainly pass under the king&rsquo;s
      eyes. What a school of style was that court!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going off to write all the news of the house for thy
      diversion, my dear little heart, and I shall write far better when I shall
      think that it is for you, madame. Mme. de Maintenon spends all her time in
      spinning, and, if they would let her, she would also give up her nights to
      it, or to writing. She toils daily for my mind; she has good hope of
      making something of it, and the darling too, who will do all he can to
      have some brains, for he is dying with the desire of pleasing the king and
      you. On the way here I read the history of Cæsar, am at present reading
      that of Alexander, and shall soon commence that of Pompey. La Couture does
      not like to lend me Mme. de Maintenon&rsquo;s petticoats, when I want to
      disguise myself as a girl. I have received the letter you write to the
      dear little darling; I was delighted with it; I will do what you bid me,
      if only to please you, for I love <span class="pagenum">[281]</span><a
      name="link281" id="link281"></a>you superlatively. I was, and am still,
      charmed with the little nod that the king gave me on leaving, but was very
      ill pleased that thou didst not seem to me sorry: thou wast beautiful as
      an angel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Could any one be more gracious, more flattering, insinuating or
      precocious? To please was a necessity at that time, to please people of
      the world, quick-witted people. Never were men more agreeable; because
      there was never greater need of being agreeable. This youth, brought up
      among petticoats, took on from the beginning a woman&rsquo;s vivacity, her
      coquetry and smiles. You see that he gets upon their knees, receives and
      gives embraces, and is amusing; there is no prettier trinket in the <i>salon.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. de Maintenon, devout, circumspect and politic, also writes, but with
      the clearness and brevity of a worldly abbess or a president in
      petticoats. &ldquo;You see that I take courage in a place more frightful
      than I can tell you; to crown the misery, we are freezing here. The
      company is poor; they respect and bore us. All the women are ill
      continually; they are loungers who have found the world really great as
      soon as ever they have been at Etampes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have amused ourselves with this raillery, dry, disdainful, clear-cut
      and somewhat too short, and I have maintained to Paul that Mme. de <span
      class="pagenum">[282]</span><a name="link282" id="link282"></a>Maintenon
      resembles the yews at Versailles, brushy extinguishers that are too
      closely clipped. Whereupon I spoke very ill of the landscapes of the
      seventeenth century, of Le Nôtre, Poussin and his architectural nature,
      Leclerc, Perelle, and of their abstract, conventional trees, whose
      majestically rounded foliage agrees with that of no known species. He
      lectured me severely, according to his custom, and called me
      narrow-minded; he maintains that all is beautiful; that all that is
      necessary is to put yourself at the right point of view. His reasoning was
      nearly as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      He claims that things please us by contrast, and that beautiful things are
      different for different souls. &ldquo;One day,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
      was travelling with some English people in Champagne, on a cloudy day in
      September. They found the plains horrible, and I admirable. The dull
      fields stretched out like a sea to the very verge of the horizon, without
      encountering a hill. The stalks of the close-reaped wheat dyed the earth
      with a wan yellow; the plain seemed covered with an old wet mantle. Here
      were lines of deformed elms; here and there a meagre square of fir-trees;
      further off a cottage of chalk with its white pool: from furrow to furrow
      the sun trailed its sickly light, and the earth, emptied of its fruits,
      was like a woman dead in child-bed whose infant they have taken away.

      &ldquo;My companions were utterly bored, and called down curses on France.
      Their minds, strained by the rude passions of politics, by the national
      arrogance, and the stiffness of scriptural morality, needed repose. They
      wanted a smiling and flowery country, meadows soft and still, fine
      shadows, largely and harmoniously grouped on the slopes of the hills..The
      sunburnt peasants, dull of countenance, sitting near a pool of mud, were
      disagreeable to them. For repose, they dreamed of pretty cottages set in
      fresh turf, fringed with rosy honeysuckle. Nothing could be more
      reasonable. A man obliged to hold himself upright and unbending finds a
      sitting posture the most beautiful..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to Versailles, and you cry out against the taste of the
      seventeenth century. Those formal and monumental waters, the firs turned
      in the lathe, the rectangular staircases heaped one above another, the
      trees drawn up like grenadiers on parade, recall to you the geometry class
      and the platoon school. Nothing can be better. But cease for an instant to
      judge according to your habits and wants of the day. You live alone, or at
      home, on a third floor in Paris, and spend four hours weekly in the
      saloons of some thirty different people. Louis XIV. lived eight hours a
      day, every day the whole year long, in public, and this public included
      all the lords of France. He held his <span class="pagenum">[286]</span><a
      name="link286" id="link286"></a>drawing-room in the open air; the
      drawing-room is the park at Versailles. Why ask of it the charms of a
      valley? These squared hedges of hornbeam are necessary that the
      embroidered coats may not be caught. This levelled and shaven turf is
      necessary that high-heeled shoes may not be wetted. The duchesses will
      form a circle about these circular sheets of water. Nothing can be better
      chosen than these immense and symmetrical staircases for showing off the
      gold and silver laced robes of three hundred ladies. These large alleys,
      which seem empty to you, were majestic when fifty lords in brocade and
      lace displayed here their <i>cordons bleus</i> and their graceful bows. No
      garden is better constructed for showing one&rsquo;s self in grand costume
      and in great company, for making a bow, for chatting and concocting
      intrigues of gallantry and business. You wish perhaps to rest, to be
      alone, to dream; you must go elsewhere; you have come to the wrong gate:
      but it would be the height of absurdity to blame a drawing-room for being
      a drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand then that our modern taste will be as transitory as
      the ancient; that is to say, that it is precisely as reasonable and as
      foolish. We have the right to admire wild, uncultivated spots, as once men
      had the right of getting tired in them. Nothing uglier to the seventeenth
      century <span class="pagenum">[287]</span><a name="link287" id="link287"></a>than
      a true mountain. It recalled a thousand ideas of misfortune.

      &ldquo;The men who had come out from the civil wars and semi-barbarism
      thought of famines, of long journeys on horseback through rain and snow,
      of the wretched black bread mingled with straw, of the foul hostelries,
      infested with vermin. They were tired of barbarism as we of civilization.
      To-day the streets are so clean, the police so abundant, the houses drawn
      out in such regular lines, manners are so peaceful, events so small and so
      clearly foreseen, that we love grandeur and the unforeseen. The landscape
      changes as literature does: then literature furnished long <span

      romances and elegant dissertations; now-a-days it offers spasmodic poetry

      CHAPTER IV. CAUTERETS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>auterets is a town
      at the bottom of a valley, melancholy enough, paved, and provided with an
      octroi. Innkeepers, guides, the whole of a famished population besieges
      us; but we have considerable force of mind, and after a spirited
      resistance we obtain the right of looking about and choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty paces further on, we are fastened upon by servants, children,
      donkey-hirers and boys, who accidentally stroll about us. They offer us
      cards, they praise up to us the site, the cuisine; they accompany us, cap
      in hand, to the very edge of the village; at the same time they elbow away
      all competitors: &ldquo;The stranger is mine, I&rsquo;ll baste you if
      <span class="pagenum">[291]</span><a name="link291" id="link291"></a>you
      come near him.&rdquo; Each hotel has its runners on the watch; they hunt
      the isard in winter, the traveller in summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town has several springs: that of the King cured Abarca, king of
      Aragon; that of Cæsar restored health, as they say, to the great Cæsar.
      Faith is needed in history as well as in medicine.
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p>
      For example, in the time of Francis I. the Eaux Bonnes cured wounds; they
      were called <i>Eaux d&rsquo;arqtiebusades </i>; the soldiers wounded at
      Pavia <span class="pagenum">[292]</span><a name="link292" id="link292"></a>were
      sent to them. Now they cure diseases of the throat and chest. A hundred
      years hence they will perhaps heal something else; with every century
      medicine makes an advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Formerly,&rdquo; said Signarelle, &ldquo;the liver was at the right
      and the heart at the left; we have reformed all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A celebrated physician one day said to his pupils: &ldquo;Employ this
      remedy at once, while it still cures.&rdquo; Medicines, like hats, have
      their fashions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet what can be said against this remedy? The climate is warm, the gorge
      sheltered, the air pure, the gayety of the sun is cheering. A change of
      habits leads to a change of thoughts; melancholy ideas take flight. The
      water is not bad to drink; you have had a beautiful journey; the moral
      cures the physical nature; if not, you have had hope for two months&mdash;and
      what, I beg to know, is a remedy, if not a pretext for hoping? You take
      patience and pleasure until either illness or invalid departs, and
      everything is for the best in the best of worlds.

      Several leagues away, among the precipices, sleeps the lake of Gaube. The

      The bald heads of the mountains are mirrored in it with a divine serenity.
      The slender column of the pines is reflected there as clear as in the air;
      in the distance, the woods clothed in bluish mist come down to bathe their
      feet in its cold wave, and the huge Vignemale, spotted with snow, shuts it
      about with her cliffs. At times a remnant of breeze comes to ruffle it,
      and all those grand images undulate; the Greek Diana, the wild, maiden
      huntress, would have taken it for a mirror.

      How one sees her come to life again in such sites! Her marbles are fallen,
      her festivals have vanished; but in the shivering of the firs, at the
      sound of the cracking glaciers, before the steely splendors of <span
      class="pagenum">[296]</span><a name="link296" id="link296"></a>these
      chaste waters, she reappears like a vision. All the night long, in the
      outcries of the wind, the herdsmen could hear the baying of her hounds and
      the whistling of her arrows; the untamed chorus of her nymphs coursed over
      the precipices; the moon shone upon their shoulders of silver, and on the
      point of their lances. In the morning she came to bathe her arms in the
      lake; and more than once has she been seen standing upon a summit, her
      eyes fixed, her brow severe; her foot trod the cruel snow, and her virgin
      breasts gleamed beneath the winter sun.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Diana of the country is more amiable; it is the lively and gracious
      Margaret of Navarre, sister and liberatress of Francis I. She came to
      these waters with her court, her poets, her musicians, her savants, a poet
      and theologian herself, of infinite curiosity, reading Greek, learning
      Hebrew, and taken up with Calvinism. On coming out of the routine and
      discipline of the middle ages, disputes about dogma and the thorns of
      erudition appeared agreeable, even to ladies; Lady Jane Grey, Elizabeth
      took part in these things: it was a fashion, as two centuries later it was
      good taste to dispute upon Newton and the existence of God. The <span
      class="pagenum">[297]</span><a name="link297" id="link297"></a>Bishop of
      Meaux wrote to Margaret: &ldquo;Madame, if there were at the end of the
      world a doctor who, by a single abridged verb, could teach you as much
      grammar as it is possible to know, and another as much rhetoric, and
      another philosophy, and so on with the seven liberal arts, each one by an
      abridged verb, you would fly there as to the fire.&rdquo; She did fly
      there and got overloaded. The heavy philosophic spoil oppressed her
      already slender thought. Her pious poems are as infantile as the odes
      written by Racine at Port-Royal. What trouble we have had in getting free
      from the middle ages! The mind bent, warped and twisted, had contracted
      the ways of a choir-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A poet of the country composed in her honor the following pretty song:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;At the baths of Toulouse
There&rsquo;s a spring clear and fair,
And three pretty doves
Came to drink and bathe there;
When at last they had bathed
Thus for months barely three,
For the heights of Cauterets
Left they fountain and me.
But why go to Cauterets,
What is there to be seen?

&ldquo;It is there that we bathe
With the king and the queen.<span class="pagenum">[298]</span><a name="link298"
      id="link298"></a>
And the king has a cot
Hung with jasmin in flower;
The dear queen has the same,
But love makes it a bower.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Is it not graceful and thoroughly southern? Margaret is less poetic, more
      French: her verses are not brilliant, but at times are very touching, by
      force of real and simple tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moderate imagination, a woman&rsquo;s heart thoroughly devoted, and
      inexhaustible in devotion, a good deal of naturalness, clearness, ease,
      the art of narration and of smiling, an agreeable but never wicked malice,
      is not this enough to make you love Margaret and read here the Heptameron?<span

      then less safe than now-a-days.

      The first day of the month of September, as the baths of the Pyrenees
      mountains begin to have virtue, were found at those of Caulderets several
      persons, from France and Spain as well as <span class="pagenum">[302]</span><a
      name="link302" id="link302"></a>other places; some to drink the water,
      others bathe in it, others to take the mud, which things are so
      marvellous, that invalids abandoned by the physicians return from them
      completely cured. But about the time of their return, there came on such
      great rains, that it seemed that God had forgotten the promise given to
      Noah never again to destroy the world by water; for all the cabins and
      dwellings of the said Caulderets were so filled with water that it became
      impossible to live in them.

      &ldquo;The French lords and ladies, thinking to return to Tarbes as easily
      as they had come, found the little brooks so swollen that they could
      scarcely ford them. But when they came to pass the Bearnese Gave, which
      was not two feet deep when they first saw it, they found it so large and
      <span class="pagenum">[303]</span><a name="link303" id="link303"></a>impetuous,
      that they made a circuit to look for the bridges, which, being nothing but
      wood, were swept away by the vehemence of the water.

      some, thinking to break the violence of the course by assembling several
      together, were so promptly swept away, that those who would follow them
      lost the power and the desire of going after.&rdquo; Whereupon they
      separated, each one seeking a way for himself. &ldquo;Two poor ladies,
      half a league beyond Pierrefitte, found a bear coming down the mountain,
      before which they galloped away in such great haste that their horses fell
      dead under them at the entrance of their dwelling; two of their women, who
      came a long time after, told them that the bear had killed all their
      serving men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So while they are all at mass, there comes into the church a man
      with nothing on but his shirt, fleeing as if some one were chasing and
      following him up. It was one of their companions by the name of Guébron,
      who recounted to them how, as he was in a hut near Pierrefitte, three men
      came while he was in bed; but he, all in his shirt as he was, with only
      his sword, wounded one of them so that he remained on the spot, and, while
      the other two amused themselves in gathering up their companion, thought
      that he could not escape if not by flight, as he was the least burdened by
      clothing. <span class="pagenum">[306]</span><a name="link306" id="link306"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The abbé of Saint-Savin furnished them with the best horses to be
      had in Lavedan, good Bearn cloaks, a quantity of provisions, and pretty
      companions to lead them safely in the mountains.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was necessary to busy themselves somewhat, while waiting for the
      Gave to go down. In the morning they went to find Mme. Oysille, the oldest
      of the ladies; they devoutly listened to the mass with her; after which
      &ldquo;she did not fail to administer the salutary food which she drew
      from the reading of the acts of the saints and glorious apostles of Jesus
      Christ.&rdquo; The afternoon was employed in a very different fashion:
      they went into a beautiful meadow along the river Gave, where the foliage
      of the trees is so dense, &ldquo;that the sun could neither pierce the
      shade nor warm the coolness, and seated themselves upon the green grass,
      which is so soft and delicate that they needed neither cushions nor
      carpets.&rdquo; And each in turn related some gallant adventure with
      details infinitely artless and singularly precise. There were some
      relating to husbands and yet more about monks. The lovely theologian is
      the grand-daughter of Boccaccio, and the grand-mother of La Fontaine.

      This shocks us, and yet is not shocking. Each age has its degree of

      The Chinese find our trousers and close-fitting coat-sleeves horribly
      immodest; I know a lady, an Englishwoman in fact, who allows only two
      parts in the body, the foot and the stomach: every other word is indecent;
      so that when her little boy has a fall, the governess must say: &ldquo;Master
      Henry has fallen, Madame, on the place where the top of his feet rejoins
      the bottom of his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The habitual ways of the sixteenth century were very different. The lords
      lived a little like men of the people; that is why they talked somewhat
      like men of the people. Bonnivet and Henri II. amused themselves in
      jumping like school-boys, and leaping over ditches twenty-three feet wide.
      When Henry VIII. of England had saluted Francis I. on the field of the
      cloth of gold, he seized him in his arms and tried to throw him, out of
      pure sportiveness; but the king, a good wrestler, laid him low by a trip.
      Fancy to-day the Emperor Napoleon at Tilsitt receiving the Emperor
      Alexander in this fashion. The ladies were obliged to be robust and agile
      as our peasants. To go to an evening party they had to mount on horseback;
      Margaret, when in Spain, fearful of being detained, made in eight days the
      stages for which a good horseman would have required fifteen days; one
      had, too, to guard one&rsquo;s self against violence; once she had need of
      her two fists and all her nails against Bonnivet. In the midst of such
      manners, free talk was only the <span class="pagenum">[310]</span><a
      name="link310" id="link310"></a>natural talk; the ladies heard it every
      day at table, and adorned with the finest commentaries. Brantôme will
      describe for you the cup from which certain lords made them drink, and
      Cellini will relate you the conversation that was held with the Duchess of
      Ferrara. A milkmaid now-a-days would be ashamed of it. Students among
      themselves, even when they are tipsy, will scarce venture what the ladies
      of honor of Catherine de Medicis sang at the top of their voice and with
      all their heart. Pardon our poor Margaret; relatively she is decent and
      delicate, and then consider that two hundred years hence, you also, my
      dear sir and madam, you will perhaps appear like very blackguards.

      Sometimes here, after a broiling day, the clouds gather, the air is
      stifling, one feels fairly ill, and a storm bursts forth. There was such
      an one last night. Each moment the heavens opened, cleft by an immense
      flash, and the vault of darkness lifted itself entire like a tent. The
      dazzling light marked out the limits of the various cultures and the forms
      of the trees at the distance of a league. The glaciers flamed with a
      bluish glimmer; the jagged peaks suddenly lifted themselves upon the
      horizon like an army of spectres. <span class="pagenum">[311]</span><a

      The gorge was illumined in its very depths; its heaped-up blocks, its
      trees hooked on to the rocks, its torn ravines, its foaming Gave, were
      seen under a livid whiteness, and vanished like the fleeting visions of an
      unknown and tortured world.

      Soon the voice of the thunder rolled in the gorges; the clouds that bore
      it crept midway along the mountain side, and came into collision among the
      rocks; the report burst out like a discharge of artillery. The wind rose
      and the rain came on. The inclined plane of the summits opened up under
      its squalls; the funeral <span class="pagenum">[314]</span><a
      name="link314" id="link314"></a>drapery of the pines clung to the sides of
      the mountain. A creeping plain came out from the rocks and trees. The long
      streaks of rain thickened the air; under the flashes you saw the water
      streaming, flooding the summits, descending the two slopes, sliding in
      sheets over the rocks, and from all sides in hurried waves running to the
      Gave. In the morning the roads were cut up with sloughs, the trees hung by
      their bleeding roots, great patches of earth had fallen away, and the
      torrent was a river.

      end of a road, are the remains of the abbey of Saint-Savin. The old church
      was, they say, built by Charlemagne; the stones, eaten and burned, are
      crumbling, the disjointed flags are incrusted with moss; from the garden
      the eye takes in the valley, brown in the evening light; the winding Gave
      already lifts into the air its trail of pale smoke.

      It was sweet here to be a monk; it is in such places that the <i>Imitation</i>

      No remembrance of good, nor hope of better. How sweet it is to renounce
      action, company, speech, to hide one&rsquo;s self, forget outside things,
      and to listen, in security and solitude, to the divine voices that, like
      collected springs, murmur peacefully in the depths of the heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      How easy is it here to forget the world! Neither books, nor news, nor
      science; no one travels and no one thinks. This valley is the whole
      universe; from time to time a peasant passes, or a man-at-arms. A moment
      more and he is gone; the mind has retained no more trace of him than the
      empty road. Every morning the eyes find again the great woods asleep upon
      <span class="pagenum">[317]</span><a name="link317" id="link317"></a>the
      mountain&rsquo;s brow, and the layers of clouds stretched out on the edge
      of the sky. The rocks light up, the summit of the forests trembles beneath
      the rising breeze, the shadow changes at the foot of the oaks, and the
      mind takes on the calm and the monotony of these slow sights by which it
      is nourished. Meanwhile the responses of the monks drone confusedly in the
      chapel; then their measured tread resounds in the high corridors. Each day
      the same hours bring back the same impressions and the same images. The
      soul empties itself of worldly ideas, and the heavenly dream, which begins
      to flow within, little by little heaps up the silent wave that is going to
      fill it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from it are science and treatises on doctrine. They drain the stream
      instead of swelling it. Will so many words augment peace and inward
      tenderness? &ldquo;The kingdom of God consisteth not in word, but in
      power.&rdquo; The heart must be moved, tears must flow, the arms must open
      toward an unseen place, and the sudden trouble will not be the work of the
      lips, but the touch of the hand divine. This hand it is which doth &ldquo;lift
      up the humble mind;&rdquo; this it is which teaches &ldquo;without noise
      of words, without confusion of opinions, without ambition of honor,
      without the scuffling of arguments.&rdquo; A light penetrates, and all at
      once the eyes see as it were a new heaven and a new earth. <span

      The men of the age perceive in its events only the events themselves; the
      solitary discovers behind the veil of things created the presence and the
      will of God. He it is who by the sun warms the earth, and by the rain
      refreshes it. He it is who sustains the mountains and envelops them at the
      setting of the sun in the repose of night. The heart feels everywhere,
      around and inside of things, an immense goodness, like a vague ocean of
      light which penetrates and animates the world; to this goodness it
      intrusts and abandons itself, like a child that drops asleep at evening on
      its mother&rsquo;s knees. A hundred times a day divine things become
      palpable to it. The light streams through the morning mist, chaste as the

      The heathen were indeed blind in their thoughts upon the grandeur of
      nature. What is our earth, but a narrow pass between two eternal worlds!
      Down there, beneath our feet, are the damned and their pains; they howl in
      their caverns and the earth trembles; without the sign of God, these walls
      would to-morrow be swallowed up in their abyss; they often come out thence
      by the bare precipices; the passers-by hear their shouts of laughter in
      the cascades; behind those gnarled beeches, glimpses have been caught of
      their grimacing countenances, their eyes of flame, and more than one
      herdsman, wandering at night towards their haunt, has been found in the
      morning with hair on end and twisted neck. But up there, in the azure,
      above the crystal, are the angels; many a time has the vault opened, and,
      in a long trail of light, the saints have appeared more radiant than
      molten silver, suddenly visible, then all at once vanished. A monk saw
      them; the last abbot was informed by them, in a vision, of the spring
      which healed his diseases. Another, long time ago, hunting wild beasts one
      day, saw a great stag stop before him with eyes filled with tears; when he
      had looked, he saw upon its antlers the cross of Jesus Christ, fell on his
      knees, and, on his <span class="pagenum">[322]</span><a name="link322"
      id="link322"></a>return to the convent, lived for thirty years doing
      penance in his cell, without any desire to leave it. Another, a very young
      man, who had gone into a forest of pines, heard far off a nightingale
      which sang marvellously; he drew near in astonishment, and it seemed to
      him that everything was transfigured; the brooks flowed as it were a long
      stream of tears, and again seemed full of pearls; the violet fringes of
      the firs shone magnificently, like a stole, upon their funereal trunks.
      The rays ran along the leaves, empurpled and azured as if by cathedral
      windows; flowers of gold and velvet opened their bleeding hearts in the
      midst of the rocks. He approached the bird, which he could not see among
      the branches, but which sang like the finest organ, with notes so piercing
      and so tender, that his heart was at once torn and melted. He saw nothing
      more of what was about him, and it seemed to him that his soul detached
      itself from his breast, and went away to the bird, and mingled itself with
      the voice which rose ever vibrating more and more in a song of ecstasy and
      anguish, as if it had been the inner voice of Christ to his Father when he
      was dying on the cross. When he returned towards the convent, he was
      astonished to find that the walls, which were quite new, had become brown
      as through age, that the little lindens in the garden were now great
      trees, that no face among the <span class="pagenum">[323]</span><a
      name="link323" id="link323"></a>monks was familiar to him, and that no one
      remembered to have seen him. Finally an infirm old monk called to mind
      that in former times they had talked to him of a novice who had gone, a
      hundred years before, into the pine forest, but who had not come back, so
      that no one had ever known what had happened to him. Thus transported and
      forgotten will those live who shall hear the inner voices. God envelops
      us, and we have only to abandon ourselves to him in order to feel him.

    <p>
      For he does not hold communion through outside things only; he is within
      us, and our thoughts are his words. He who retires within himself, who
      listens no more to the news of this world, who effaces from his mind its
      reasonings and imaginations, and who holds himself in expectancy, in
      silence and solitude, sees little by little a thought rise in him which is
      not his own, which comes and goes without his will, and, whatever he may
      will, which fills and enchants him, like those words, heard in a dream,
      which make tranquil the soul with their mysterious song. The soul listens
      and no longer perceives the flight of the hours; all its powers are
      arrested, and its movements are nothing but the impressions which come to
      it from above. Christ speaks, it answers; it asks, and he teaches; it is
      afflicted, and he consoles. &ldquo;My son, now will I teach thee the way
      of peace and true liberty. <span class="pagenum">[324]</span><a
      name="link324" id="link324"></a>O Lord, I beseech thee, do as thou sayest,
      for this is delightful for me to hear. <i>Be desirous, my son, to do the
      will of another rather than thine own, choose always to have less rather
      than more. Seek always the lowest place, and to be inferior to every one.
      Wish always, and pray, that the will of God may be wholly fulfilled in
      thee. Behold such a man entereth within the borders of peace and rest.</i>
      O Lord, this short discourse of thine containeth within itself much
      perfection. It is little to be spoken, but full of meaning, and abundant
      in fruit.&rdquo; How languid is everything alongside of this divine
      company! How all which departs from it is unsightly! &ldquo;When Jesus is
      present, all is well, and nothing seems difficult: but when Jesus is
      absent everything is hard. When Jesus speaks not inwardly to us, all other
      comfort is nothing worth; but if Jesus speak but one word, we feel great
      consolation. How dry and hard art thou without Jesus! How foolish and
      vain, if thou desire anything out of Jesus! Is not this a greater loss
      than if thou shouldest lose the whole world? He that findeth Jesus,
      findeth a good treasure, yea, a Good above all good. And he that loseth
      Jesus, loseth much indeed, yea, more than the whole world! Most poor is he
      who liveth without Jesus; and he most rich who is well with Jesus. It is
      matter of great skill to know how to hold converse with Jesus; and to know
      how to keep Jesus, a <span class="pagenum">[325]</span><a name="link325"
      id="link325"></a>point of great wisdom. Be thou humble and peaceable, and
      Jesus will be with thee. Be devout and quiet, and Jesus will stay with
      thee..Thou mayest soon drive away Jesus and lose his favor if thou wilt
      turn aside to outward things. And if thou shouldest drive him from thee,
      and lose him, unto whom wilt thou flee, and whom wilt thou seek for thy
      friend? Without a friend thou canst not well live; and if Jesus be not
      above all a friend to thee, thou shalt be sad and desolate.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Behold!
      My God, and all things.&rdquo; What can I wish more, and what happier
      thing can I long for? &ldquo;My God, and all things.&rdquo; To him that
      understandeth, enough is said; and to repeat it often is delightful to him
      that loveth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some died of this love, lost in ecstasies or drowned in a divine languor.
      These are the great poets of the middle ages.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rom Luz to
      Gavarnie is eighteen miles. It is enjoined upon every living creature able
      to mount a horse, a mule, or any quadruped whatever, to visit Gavarnie; in
      default of other beasts, he should, putting aside all shame, bestride an
      ass. Ladies and convalescents are taken there in sedan-chairs.

      Otherwise, think what a figure you will make on your return.

      What then did you go to the Pyrenees for?
    </p>
    <p>
      You hang your head, and your friend triumphs, especially if he was bored
      at Gavarnie. You undergo a description of Gavarnie after the last edition
      of the guide-book. Gavarnie is a sublime <span class="pagenum">[327]</span><a
      name="link327" id="link327"></a>sight; tourists go sixty miles out of
      their way to see it; the Duchess d&rsquo;Angoulême had herself carried to
      the furthest rocks; Lord Bute, when he saw it for the first time, cried:
      &ldquo;If I were now at the extremity of India, and suspected the
      existence of what I see at this moment, I should immediately leave in
      order to enjoy and admire it!&rdquo; You are overwhelmed with quotations
      and supercilious smiles; you are convicted of laziness, of dulness of
      mind, and, as certain English travellers say, of <i>unæsthetic
      insensibility.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are but two resources: to learn a description by heart, or to make
      the journey. I have made the journey, and am going to give the
      description.

      II.

    <p>
      We leave at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, by the road to Scia, in the
      fog, without seeing at first anything beyond great confused forms of trees
      and rocks. At the end of a quarter of an hour, we hear along the pathway a
      noise of sharp cries drawing near: it was a funeral procession coming from
      Scia. Two men bore a small coffin under a white shroud; behind came four
      herdsmen in long cloaks and brown capuchons, silent, with bent heads; four
      women followed in black mantles. It was they <span class="pagenum">[328]</span><a
      name="link328" id="link328"></a>who uttered those monotonous and piercing
      lamentations; one knew not if they were wailing or praying. They walked
      with long steps through the cold mist, without stopping or looking at any
      one, and were going to bury the poor body in the cemetery at Luz.

      At Scia the road passes over a small bridge very high up, which commands
      another bridge, gray and abandoned. The double tier of arches bends
      gracefully over the blue torrent; meanwhile a pale light already floats in
      the diaphanous mist; a golden gauze undulates above the <span

      aërial veil grows thin and will soon vanish.

      Nothing can convey the idea of this light, so youthful, timid and smiling,
      which glitters like the bluish wings of a dragon-fly that is pursued and
      is taken captive in a net of fog. Beneath, the boiling water is engulfed
      in a narrow conduit and leaps like a mill-race. The column of foam, thirty
      feet high, falls with a furious din, and its glaucous waves, heaped
      together in the deep ravine, dash against each other and are broken upon a
      line of fallen rocks. Other enormous rocks, debris of the same mountain,
      hang above the road, their squared heads crowned with brambles for hair;
      ranged in impregnable line, they seem to watch the torments of the Gave,
      which their brothers hold beneath themselves crushed and subdued.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We turn a second bridge and enter the plain of Gèdres, verdant and
      cultivated, where the hay is in cocks; they are harvesting; our horses
      walk between two hedges of hazel; we go along by orchards; but the
      mountain is ever near; the guide shows us a rock three times the height of
      a man, which, two years ago, rolled down and demolished a house. <span
      class="pagenum">[332]</span><a name="link332" id="link332"></a>We
      encounter several singular caravans: a band of young priests in black
      hats, black gloves, black cassocks tucked up, black stockings, very
      apparent, novices in horsemanship who bound at every step, like the Gave;
      a big, jolly round man, in a sedan-chair, his hands crossed over his
      belly, who looks on us with a paternal air, and reads his newspaper; three
      ladies of sufficiently ripe age, very slender, very lean, very stiff, who,
      for dignity&rsquo;s sake, set their beasts on a trot as we draw near them.
      The cicisbeo is a bony cartilaginous gentleman, fixed perpendicularly on
      his saddle like a telegraph-pole. We hear a harsh clucking, as of a choked
      hen, and we recognize the English tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the French nation, it is but poorly represented at Gèdres. First
      appears a long, mouldy custom-house officer, who indorses the permission
      to pass of the horses; with his once green coat the poor man had the air
      of having sojourned a week in the river. No sooner has he let us go, than
      a blackguard band, boys and girls, pounces upon us; some stretch out their
      hands, others wish to sell stones to us; they motion to the guide to stop;
      they claim the travellers; two or three hold the bridle of each horse, and
      all cry in chorus: &ldquo;The grotto! the grotto!&rdquo; There is nothing
      for it but to resign ourselves and see the grotto.<span class="pagenum">[333]</span><a

      A servant opens a door, makes us descend two staircases, throws a lump of
      earth in passing into a lagune, to awaken the sleeping fish, takes
      half-a-dozen steps over a couple of planks. &ldquo;Well, the grotto?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Behold
      it, Monsieur.&rdquo; We see a streamlet of water between two rocks
      overhung with ash-trees. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; She does not
      understand, opens her eyes wide and goes away. We ascend again and read
      this inscription: <i>The charge for seeing the grotto is ten cents.</i>
      The matter is all explained. The peasants of the Pyrenees are not wanting
      in brains.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Beyond Gèdres is a wild valley called Chaos, which is well named. After
      quarter of an hour&rsquo;s journey there, the trees disappear, then the
      juniper and the box, and finally the moss; the Gave is no longer seen; all
      noises are hushed. It is a dead solitude peopled with wrecks. Three
      avalanches of rocks and crushed flint have come down from the summit to
      the very bottom. The horrid tide, high and a quarter of a league in
      length, spreads out like waves its myriads of sterile stones, and the
      inclined sheet seems still to glide towards inundating the gorge. These
      stones are shattered and pulverized; their living fractures and thin harsh
      points wound the eye; they are still bruising and crushing <span
      class="pagenum">[336]</span><a name="link336" id="link336"></a>each other.
      Not a bush, not a spear of grass; the arid grayish train burns beneath a
      sun of brass; its débris are scorched to a dull hue, as in a furnace. A
      ruined mountain is more desolate than any human ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred paces further on, the aspect of the valley becomes formidable.
      Troops of mammoths and mastodons in stone lie crouching over the eastern
      declivity, one above another, and heaped up over the whole slope. These
      colossal ridges shine with a tawny hue like iron rust; the most enormous
      of them drink the water of the river at their base. They look as if
      warming their bronzed skin in the sun, and sleep, turned over, stretched
      out on their side, resting in all attitudes, and always gigantic and
      frightful. Their deformed paws are curled up; their bodies half buried in
      the earth; their monstrous backs rest one upon another. When you enter
      into the midst of the prodigious band, the horizon disappears, the blocks
      rise fifty feet into the air; the road winds painfully among the
      overhanging masses; men and horses seem but dwarfs; these rusted edges
      mount in stages to the very summit, and the dark hanging army seems ready
      to fall on the human insects which come to trouble its sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, the mountain, in a paroxysm of fever, shook its summits
      like a cathedral that is falling in.<span class="pagenum">[337]</span><a

      The whole shattered ridge totters. Beneath them the rock fails suddenly in
      a living and still bleeding wound. The splinters are lower down, strewn
      over the declivity. The tumbled rocks are sustained one upon another, and
      man today passes in safety amidst the disaster. But what a day was that of
      the ruin! It is not very ancient, perhaps of the sixth century, and the
      year of the terrible earthquake told of by Gregory of Tours. If a man
      could without perishing have seen the <span class="pagenum">[340]</span><a
      name="link340" id="link340"></a>summits split, totter and fall, the two
      seas of rock come bounding into the gorge, meet one another and grind each
      other amidst a shower of sparks, he would have looked upon the grandest
      spectacle ever seen by human eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the west, a perpendicular mole, crannied like an old ruin, lifts itself
      straight up towards the sky. A leprosy of yellowish moss has incrusted its
      pores, and has clothed it all over with a sinister livery. This livid robe
      upon this parched stone has a splendid effect. Nothing is uglier than the
      chalky flints that are drawn from the quarry; just dug up, they seem cold
      and damp in their whitish shroud; they are not used to the sun; they make
      a contrast with the rest. But the rock that has lived in the air for ten
      thousand years, where the light has every day laid on and melted its
      metallic tints, is the friend of the sun, and carries its mantle upon its
      shoulders; it has no need of a garment of verdure; if it suffers from
      parasitic vegetations, it sticks them to its sides and imprints them with
      its colors. The threatening tones with which it clothes itself suits the
      free sky, the naked landscape, the powerful heat that environs it; it is
      alive like a plant; only it is of another age, one more severe and
      stronger than that in which we vegetate. <span class="pagenum">[341]</span><a

      V.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Gavarnie is a very ordinary village, commanding a view of the amphitheatre
      we are come to see. After you have left it, it is still necessary to go
      three miles through a melancholy plain, half buried in sand by the winter
      inundations; the waters of the Gave are muddy and dull; a cold wind
      whistles from the amphitheatre; the glaciers, strewn with mud and stones,
      are stuck to the declivity like patches of dirty plaster. The mountains
      are bald and ravined by cascades; black cones of scattered firs climb them
      like routed soldiers; a meagre and wan turf wretchedly clothes their
      mutilated heads. The horses ford the Gave stumblingly, chilled by the
      water coming from the snows. In this wasted solitude you meet, all of a
      sudden, the most smiling parterre. A throng of the lovely iris crowds
      itself into the bed of a dried torrent: the sun stripes with rays of gold
      their velvety petals of tender blue; the harvest of plumes winds with the
      sinuosities of the bank, and the eye follows over the whole plain the
      folds of the rivulet of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We climb a last eminence, sown with iris and with stones. There is a hut
      where you breakfast and leave the horses. You arm yourself with a stout
      stick, and descend upon the glaciers of the amphitheatre. <span

      These glaciers are very ugly, very dirty, very uneven, very slippery; at
      every step you run the risk of falling, and if you fall it is on sharp
      stones or into deep holes. They look like heaps of old plaster-work, and
      those who have admired them have a stock of admiration for sale.

      The water has pierced them so that you walk upon bridges of snow. These
      bridges have the appearance of kitchen air-holes; the water is swallowed
      up in a very low archway, and, when you look closely, you get a distinct
      sight of a black hole. An Englishman who wished to enjoy the view, allowed
      himself to fall, and came out half dead, &ldquo;with the rapidity of a
      trout.&rdquo; We left such experiments to the trout and the English. <span

      After the glaciers we find a sloping esplanade; we climb for ten minutes
      bruising our feet upon fragments of sharp rock. Since leaving the hut we
      have not lifted our eyes, in order to reserve for ourselves an unbroken
      sensation. Here at last we look. <span class="pagenum">[344]</span><a
      name="link344" id="link344"></a>A wall of granite crowned with snow
      hollows itself before us in a gigantic amphitheatre. This amphitheatre is
      twelve hundred feet high, nearly three miles in circumference, three tiers
      of perpendicular walls, and in each tier thousands of steps.

      The valley ends there; the wall is a single block, and impregnable. The
      other summits might fall, but its massive layers would not be moved. The
      mind is overwhelmed by the idea of a stability that cannot be shaken and
      an assured eternity. There is the boundary of two countries and two races;
      this it is that Roland wanted to break, when with a sword-stroke he opened
      a breach in the summit. But the immense wound disappeared in the immensity
      of the conquered wall.<span class="pagenum">[345]</span><a name="link345"

      Three sheets of snow are spread out over the three tiers of layers. The
      sun falls with all its force upon; this virginal robe without being able
      to make it shine. It will preserve its dead whiteness. All this grandeur
      is austere; the air is chilled beneath the noonday rays; great, damp
      shadows creep along the foot of the walls. It is the everlasting winter
      and the nakedness of the desert. The sole inhabitants are the cascades
      assembled to form the Gave.

      The streamlets of water come by thousands from the highest layer, leap
      from step to step, cross their stripes of foam, wind, unite and fall by a
      dozen brooks that slide from the last layer in flaky streaks to lose
      themselves in the glaciers of the bottom. The thirteenth cascade on the
      left is twelve hundred and sixty-six feet <span class="pagenum">[348]</span><a
      name="link348" id="link348"></a>high. It falls slowly, like a dropping
      cloud, or the unfolding of a muslin veil; the air softens its fall; the
      eye follows complacently the graceful undulation of the beautiful airy
      veil. It glides the length of the rock, and seems to float rather than to
      fall. The sun shines, through its plume, with the softest and loveliest
      splendor. It reaches the bottom like a bouquet of slender waving feathers,
      and springs backward in a silver dust; the fresh and transparent mist
      swings about the rock it bathes, and its rebounding train mounts lightly
      along the courses. No stir in the air; no noise, no living creature in
      this solitude. You hear only the monotonous murmur of the cascades,
      resembling the rustle of the leaves that the wind stirs in the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our return, we seated ourselves at the door of the hut. It is a poor,
      squat little house, heavily supported upon thick walls; the knotty joists
      of the ceiling retain their bark. It is indeed necessary that it should be
      able to stand out alone against the snows of winter. You find everywhere
      the imprint of the terrible months it has gone through. Two dead fir-trees
      stand erect at the door. The garden, three feet square, is defended by
      enormous walls of piled-up slates. The low and black stable leaves neither
      foot-hold nor entry for the winds. A lean colt was seeking a little grass
      among the stones. <span class="pagenum">[349]</span><a name="link349"

      A small bull, with surly air, looked at us out of the sides of his eyes;
      the animals, the trees and the site, wore a threatening or melancholy
      aspect. But in the clefts of a rock were growing some admirable
      buttercups, lustrous and splendid, which looked as if painted by a ray of
      sunshine.

      At the village we met our companions of the journey who had sat down
      there.. The good tourists get fatigued, stop ordinarily at the inn, take a
      substantial dinner, have a chair brought to the door, and digest while
      looking at the amphitheatre, which from there appears about as high as a
      house. After this they return, praising the sublime sight, and very glad
      that they have come to the Pyrenees.

      A stony, zigzag pathway excoriates the green mountain with its whitish
      track. The view changes with every turn. Above and below us are meadows
      with girls making hay, and little houses stuck to the declivity like
      swallows&rsquo; nests. Lower down, an immense pit of black rock, to which
      from all sides hasten streams of silver. The higher up we are, the more
      the valleys are contracted and fade from sight; the more the gray
      mountains <span class="pagenum">[353]</span><a name="link353" id="link353"></a>enlarge
      and spread themselves in all their hugeness. Suddenly, beneath the burning
      sun, the perspective becomes confused; we feel the cold and damp touch of
      some unknown and invisible being. A moment after, the air clears up, and
      we perceive behind us the white, rounded back of a beautiful cloud fleeing
      into the distance, and whose shadow glides lightly over the slope. The
      useful herbage soon disappears; scorched mosses, thousands of
      rhododendrons clothe the barren escarpments; the road is damaged by the
      force of the hidden springs; it is encumbered with rolling stones. It
      turns with every ten paces, in order to conquer the steepness of the
      slopes. You reach at last a naked ridge, where you dismount from your
      horse; here begins the top of the mountain. You walk for ten minutes over
      a carpet of serried heather, and you are upon the highest summit.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a view! Everything human disappears; villages, enclosures,
      cultivations, all seem like the work of ants. I have two valleys under my
      eyes, which seem two little bands of earth lost in a blue funnel. Nothing
      exists here but the mountains. Our roads and our works have scratched upon
      them an imperceptible point; we are mites, who lodge, between two
      awakings, under one of the hairs of an elephant. Our civilization is a
      pretty, miniature toy, with which nature amuses herself for <span

      You see nothing but a throng of mountains seated under the burning dome of
      heaven. They are ranged in an amphitheatre, like a council of immovable
      and eternal being&rsquo;s. All considerations are overpowered by the
      sensation of immensity: monstrous ridges which stretch themselves out,
      gigantic, bony spines, ploughed flanks that drop down precipitously into
      indistinguishable depths.<span class="pagenum">[355]</span><a

      It is as though you were in a bark in the middle of the sea. The
      mountain-chains clash like billows. The tops are sharp and jagged like the
      crests of uplifted waves; they come from all sides, athwart each other,
      piled one above another, bristling, innumerable, and the flood of granite
      mounts high into the sky at the four corners of the horizon. On the north,
      the valleys of Luz and Argelès open up in the plain by a bluish vista,
      shining with a dead splendor resembling two ewers of burnished pewter. On
      the west the chain of Bareges stretches like a saw as far as the Pic du
      Midi, a huge, ragged-edged axe, marked with patches of snow; on the east,
      lines of leaning fir-trees mount to the assault of the summits. In the
      south an army of embattled peaks, of ridges cut to the quick, squared
      towers, spires, perpendicular escarpments, lifts itself beneath a mantle
      of snow; the glaciers glitter between the dark rocks; the black ledges
      stand out with an extraordinary relief against the deep blue. These rude
      forms pain the eye; you are oppressively alive to the rigidness of the
      masses of granite which have burst through the crust of our planet, and
      the invincible ruggedness of the rock that is lifted above the clouds.
      This chaos of violently broken lines tells of the effort of forces of
      which we have no longer any idea. <span class="pagenum">[358]</span><a
      name="link358" id="link358"></a>Since then Nature has grown mild; she
      rounds and softens the forms she moulds; she embroiders in the valleys her
      leafy robe, and, as an industrious artist, she shapes the delicate foliage
      of her plants. Here, in her primitive barbarism, she only knew how to
      cleave the blocks and heap up the rough masses of her Cyclopean
      constructions. But her monument is sublime, worthy of the heaven it has
      for a vault and the sun which is its torch.

      Geology is a noble science. Upon this summit theories grow lively; the
      arguments of the books breathe new life into the story of the mountains,
      and the past appears grander than the present. This country was in the
      beginning a solitary and boiling sea, then slowly cooled, finally peopled
      by living creatures and built up by their debris. Thus were formed the
      ancient limestones, the slates of transition and several of the secondary
      rocks. What myriads of ages are accumulated in a single phrase! Time is a
      solitude in which we set up here and there our boundaries; they reveal its
      immensity, but do not measure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This crust cleaves, and a long wave of molten granite heaves itself up,
      forming the lofty chain of <span class="pagenum">[359]</span><a

      From here you see Néouvielle in the north-east. How this wall of fire
      worked in lifting itself amidst this upturned sea, the imagination of man
      will never conceive. The liquid mass of granite formed a paste among the
      rocks; the lower layers were changed into slate beneath the fiery blast;
      the level grounds rose up, and were overturned. The subterranean stream
      rose with an effort so abrupt, that they were stuck to its flanks in
      layers almost perpendicular. &ldquo;It was congealed in torment, and its
      agitation is still painted in its petrified waves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How much time rolled away between this revolution and the next? Monuments
      are wanting; the centuries have left no traces. There is a page torn out
      in the history of the earth. Our ignorance like our knowledge overwhelms
      us. We see one infinity, and from it we divine another which we do not
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the ocean changed its bed, perhaps from the uplifting of America;
      from the south-west came a sea to burst upon the chain. The shock fell
      upon the dark embattled barrier that you see towards Gavarnie. There was a
      frightful destruction of marine animals: Their corpses have formed the
      shelly banks that you cross in mounting to la Brèche; several layers of la
      Brèche, of the <span class="pagenum">[362]</span><a name="link362"
      id="link362"></a>Taillon and of Mont Perdu, are fields still fetid with
      death. The rolling sea, tearing up its bed, drifted it against the wall of
      rocks, piled it against the sides, heaped it upon the summits, set
      mountain upon mountain, covered the immense rock, and oscillated in
      furious currents in its ravaged basin.

      I seemed to see on the horizon the oozy surface coming higher than the
      summits, lifting its waves against the sky, eddying in the valleys, and
      howling above the drowned mountains like a tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sea was bringing half of the Pyrenees; its raging waters overlaid the
      primitive declivity with calcareous strata, tilted and torn; upon these
      the quieted waters deposited the high horizontal layers. <span
      class="pagenum">[363]</span><a name="link363" id="link363"></a>Yonder, in
      the south-west, the Vignemale is covered with them. In order to raise up
      the summits, generations of marine creatures were born and died silent and
      inert populations which swarmed in the warm ooze, and watched through
      their green waves the rays of the blue-tinged sun. They have perished
      along with their sepulchre; the storms have torn open the banks where they
      had buried themselves, and these shreds of their wreck scarce tell how
      many myriads of centuries this shrouded world has seen pass away.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day at last, the great mountains which form the horizon on the south
      were seen to grow, Troumousse, the Vignemale, Mont Perdu, and all the
      summits that surround Gèdres. The soil had burst open a second time. A
      wave of new granite arose, laden with the ancient granite, and with the
      prodigious mass of the limestones; the alluvia rose to more than ten
      thousand feet; the ancient summits of pure granite were surpassed; the
      beds of shells were lifted into the clouds, and the upheaved tops found
      themselves forever above the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two seas have dwelt upon these summits; two streams of burning rock have
      erected these chains. What will be the next revolution? How long time will
      man yet last? A contraction of the crust which bears him will cause a wave
      of lava to gush forth or will displace the level of the seas. We live
      <span class="pagenum">[364]</span><a name="link364" id="link364"></a>between
      two accidents of the soil; our history occupies, with room to spare, a
      line in the history of the earth; our life depends upon a variation in the
      heat; our duration is for a moment, and our force a nothing. We resemble
      the little blue forget-me-nots which you pluck as you go down the slope;
      their form is delicate, their structure admirable; nature lavishes them
      and crushes them; she uses all her industry in shaping them, and all her
      carelessness in destroying them. There is more art in them than in the
      whole mountain. Have they any ground for pretending that the mountain was

      &ldquo;Set out in the mist at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The
      pastures of Tau through the mist; the mist is distinctly visible. The lake
      of Oncet through the mist; same view.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Howker of the Five Bears. Several whitish or grayish spots on a
      whitish or grayish ground. To form an idea of it, look at five or six
      wafers, of a dirty white, stuck behind a leaf of blotting-paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beginning of the steep rise; ascent at a footpace, head of one to
      tail of another; this recalls to <span class="pagenum">[365]</span><a
      name="link365" id="link365"></a>me Leblanc&rsquo;s riding-school, and the
      fifty horses advancing gracefully in the saw-dust, each one with his nose
      against the tail of the one before him, and his tail against the nose of
      his follower, as it used to be on Thursdays, the school-day for going out
      and for the riding lesson. I cradle myself voluptuously in the poetical
      remembrance.

      &ldquo;First hour: view of the back of my guide and the hind-quarters of
      his horse. The guide has a vest of bottle-green velvet, darned in two
      places, on the right and on the left; the horse is a dirty brown and bears

      high upon the declivities, even beyond three thousand feet. Their huge
      pillars strike down into the hollows where earth is gathered. Their roots
      enter into the clefts of the rock, lift it, and come creeping to the
      surface like a family of snakes. Their skin, white and tender in the
      plains, is changed into a grayish and solid bark; their tenacious leaves
      shine with a vigorous green, beneath the sun which cannot penetrate them.
      They live isolated, because they need space, and range themselves at
      intervals one above another like lines of towers. From afar, between the
      dull heather, their mound rises splendid with light, and sounds with its
      hundred thousand leaves as with so many little bells of horn. <span

      But the real inhabitants of the mountains are the pines, geometrical
      trees, akin to the ferruginous blocks hewn by the primitive eruptions. The
      vegetation of the plains unfolds itself in undulating forms with all the
      graceful caprices of liberty and wealth. The pines, on the other hand,
      seem scarcely alive; their shaft rises in a perpendicular line along the
      rocks; their horizontal branches part from the trunk at right angles,
      equal as the radii of a circle, and the entire tree is a cone terminated
      by a naked spike. The dull little blades that answer for leaves have a
      melancholy hue, without transparency or lustre; they seem hostile to the
      light; they neither reflect it, nor allow it to pass, they extinguish it;
      hardly does the noonday sun fringe them with a bluish reflection. Ten
      paces away, beneath such an aureole, the black pyramid cuts the horizon
      like an opaque mass. They crowd together in files under their funereal
      mantles. Their forests are silent as solitudes; the whistle of the wind
      makes there no noise; it glides over the stiff beard of the leaves without
      stirring or rubbing them together. One hears no sound save the whispering
      of the tops and the shrivelling of the little yellowish lamels which fall
      in showers as soon as you touch a branch. <span class="pagenum">[369]</span><a

      The turf is dead, the soil naked; you walk in the shade beneath an
      inanimate verdure, among pale shafts which rise like tapers. A strong odor
      fills the air, resembling the perfume of aromatics. The impression is that
      made by a deserted cathedral, while, after a ceremony, the smell of
      incense still floats under the arches, and the declining day outlines far
      away in the obscurity the forest of pillars.
    </p>
    <p>
      They live in families and expel the other trees from their domain. Often,
      in a wasted gorge, they may be seen like a mourning drapery descending
      among the white glaciers. They love the cold, and in winter remain clothed
      in snow. Spring does not renew them; you see only a few green lines run
      through the foliage; they soon grow dark like the rest. But when the tree
      springs from a spot of deep earth, and rises to a height of a hundred
      feet, smooth and straight as the mast of a ship, the mind with buoyancy
      follows to the very summit the flight of its inflexible form, and the
      vegetable column seems as grand as the mountain which nurtures it.

      Higher up, on the barren steeps, the yellowish box twists its knotty feet
      beneath the stones. It is a melancholy and tenacious creature, stunted
      <span class="pagenum">[372]</span><a name="link372" id="link372"></a>and
      thrust back upon itself; overborne amidst the rocks, it dares not shoot
      upward nor spread. Its small thick leaves follow each other in monotonous
      rows, clumsily oval and of a formal regularity. Its stem, short and
      grayish, is rough to the touch; the round fruit encloses black capsules,
      hard as ebony, that must be broken open for the seed. Everything in the
      plant is calculated with a view to utility: it thinks only of lasting and
      resisting; it has neither ornaments, elegance, nor richness; it expends
      its sap only in solid tissues, in dull colors, in durable fibres. It is an
      economical and active housewife, the only thing capable of vegetating in
      the quagmires that it fills.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you continue to ascend, the trees begin to fail. The brush-fir creeps
      in a carpet of turf. The rhododendrons grow in tufts and crown the
      mountain with rosy clusters. The heather crowds its white bunches, small,
      open, vase-shaped flowers, from which springs a crown of garnet stamens.
      In the sheltered hollows, the blue campanulas swing their pretty bells;
      the least wind lays them low; they live for all that, and smile, trembling
      and graceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, among all these flowers nourished with light and pure air, the most
      precious is the thornless rose. Never did petals form a frailer and lovelier
      corolla; never did a vermilion so vivid color a more delicate tissue.

      the summit grow the mosses. Battered by the wind, dried by the sun, they
      lose the fresh green tint they wear in the valleys and on the brink of the
      springs. They are reddened with tawny hues, and their smooth filaments
      have the reflexes of a wolf&rsquo;s fur. Others, yellowed and pale, cover
      with their sickly colors the bleeding crevices. Then there are gray ones,
      almost white, which grow like remnants of hair upon the bald rocks. Far
      away, upon the back of the mountain, all these tints are mingled, and the
      shaded fur emits a wild gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last growths are reddish crusts, stuck to the walls of rock, seeming
      to form part of the stone, and which you might take, not for a plant, but

      The bear is a serious beast, a thorough mountaineer, curious to behold in
      his great-coat of felted hair, yellowish or grayish in color. It seems
      formed <span class="pagenum">[376]</span><a name="link376" id="link376"></a>for
      its domicile and its domicile for it. Its heavy fur is an excellent mantle
      against the snow. The mountaineers think it so good, that they borrow it
      from him as often as they can, and he thinks it so good that he defends it
      against them to the best of his ability. He likes to live alone, and the
      gorges of the heights are as solitary as he wishes.

      The hollow trees afford him a ready-made house; as these are for the most
      part beeches and oaks, he finds in them at once food and shelter. For the
      rest, brave, prudent, and robust, he is an estimable animal; his only
      faults are that he eats his little ones, when he runs across them, and
      that he is a poor dancer. <span class="pagenum">[377]</span><a

      In hunting him, they go into ambush and fire on him as he passes. Lately,
      in a battue, a superb female was tracked. When the foremost hunters, who
      were novices, saw the glitter of the little fierce eyes, and perceived the
      black mass descending with great strides, beating the underbrush, they
      forgot all of a sudden that they had guns, and kept whist behind their
      oak. A hundred paces further on, a brave fellow fired. The bear, which was
      not hit, came up on a gallop. The man, dropping his gun, slipped into a
      pit. Reaching the bottom, he felt of his limbs, and by some miracle found
      himself whole, when he saw the animal hesitating above <span
      class="pagenum">[378]</span><a name="link378" id="link378"></a>his head,
      busy in examining the slope, and pressing her foot upon the stones to see
      if they were firm. She sniffed here and there, and looked at the man with
      the evident intention of paying him a visit. The pit was a well; if she
      reached the bottom, he must resign himself to a tête-à-tête. While the man
      reflected on this, and thought of the animal&rsquo;s teeth, the bear began
      to descend with infinite precaution and address, managing her precious
      person with great care, hanging on to the roots, slowly, but without ever
      stumbling. She was drawing near, when the hunters came up and shot her
      dead.

      The isard dwells above the bear, upon the naked tops, in the region of the
      glaciers. He needs space for his leaps and gambols. He is too lively and
      gay to shut himself, like the heavy misanthrope, in the gorges and
      forests. No animal is more agile; he leaps from rock to rock, clears
      precipices, and keeps <span class="pagenum">[379]</span><a name="link379"
      id="link379"></a>his place upon points where there is just room for his
      four feet You sometimes hear a hollow bleating on the heights: it is a
      band of isards cropping the herbage amidst the snow; their tawny dress and
      their little horns stand out in the blue of the heavens; one of them gives
      the alarm and all disappear in a moment.

      You often hear for a half-hour a tinkling of bells behind the mountain;
      these are the herds of goats changing their pasture. Sometimes there are
      more than a thousand of them. You find yourself stopped in crossing the
      bridges until the whole caravan has filed over. They have long hanging
      hairs which form their coat; with their black mantle and great beard, you
      would say that they were <span class="pagenum">[380]</span><a
      name="link380" id="link380"></a>dressed for a masquerade. Their yellow
      eyes stare vaguely, with an expression of curiosity and gentleness. They
      seem to wonder at their walking in such orderly fashion on level ground.
      Only to look at that dry leg and horny foot, you feel that they are framed
      to wander at random and leap about on the rocks. From time to time the
      less disciplined ones stop, set their fore feet against the mountain, and
      crop a bramble or a blossom of lavender. The others come and push them on;
      they start off again with a mouthful of herbage, and eat as they walk. All
      their physiognomies are intelligent, resigned and melancholy, with flashes
      of caprice and originality. You see the forest of horns waving above the
      black mass, and their smooth hair shining in the sun. Enormous dogs, with
      woolly coat, spotted with white, walk gravely along the sides, growling
      when you draw near. The herdsman comes behind in his brown cloak, with an
      eye fixed, glittering, void of thought, like that of the animals; and the
      whole band disappears in a cloud of dust, out of which comes a sound of
      shrill bleating.

      They make holes in the heated sand, and sleep there in groups of five or
      six, close set in lines, in admirable order. When any one draws near, the
      whole mass moves; the corkscrew tails frisk fantastically; two crafty,
      philosophic eyes open beneath the pendent ears; the mocking noses stretch
      forth and snuff; they all grunt in concert; after which, becoming
      accustomed to the intrusion, they are quieted, they lie down again, the
      eyes close <span class="pagenum">[384]</span><a name="link384" id="link384"></a>in
      sanctimonious fashion, the tails retire into place, and the blessed rogues
      return to their digestion and enjoyment of the sun. All these expressive
      snouts seem to cry shame upon prejudices, and invoke enjoyment; there is
      something reckless and derisive about them; the whole countenance is
      directed towards the snout, and the end of the entire head is in the
      mouth. Their lengthened nose seems to sniff and take in from the air all
      agreeable sensations. They spread themselves so complacently on the
      ground, they wag their ears with such voluptuous little movements, they
      utter such penetrating ejaculations of pleasure, that you get out of
      patience with them. Oh genuine epicureans, if sometimes in your sleep you
      deign to reflect, you ought to think, like the goose of Montaigne, that
      the world was made for you, that man is your servant, and that you are the
      privileged creatures of nature. There is but one moment of trouble in
      their whole life, that is when they are killed. Still they pass quickly
      away and do not foresee this moment.

      VIII.

    <p>
      Myriads of lizards nestle in the chinks of slate and in the walls of
      rounded pebbles. On the approach of a passer-by, they run like a streak
      across <span class="pagenum">[385]</span><a name="link385" id="link385"></a>the
      road. If you stand quiet for a moment, you see their little restless, sly
      heads peep out between two stones; the rest of the body shows itself, the
      tail wriggles, and, with an abrupt movement, they climb zigzag upon the
      gravelly ledges. There they have as much sun as they please, sun to roast
      alive in; at noon, the rock burns the hand. This powerful sun heats their
      cold blood, and gives spring and action to their limbs. They are
      capricious, passionate, violent, and fight like men. Sometimes you may see
      two of them rolling the whole length of a rock, one over the other, in the
      dust, get up again dimmed and dirty, and run briskly away, like cowardly
      and insubordinate schoolboys taken in a misdeed. Some of them lose their
      tails in these adventures, so that they look as if they wore a coat that
      is too short for them; they hide, ashamed of being so ill dressed. Others
      in their gray justi-coats have slight, graceful motions, an air at once so
      coquettish and timid that it takes away all desire to harm them. When they
      are asleep on a slab of stone, you can see their whitish throat and their
      small, intelligent mouth; but they scarcely, ever sleep, they are always
      on the lookout; they scamper off at the least sound, and, when nothing
      troubles them, they trot, frolic, climb up and down, make a hundred turns
      for pleasure. They love company, and live near or with one another. No
      animal is <span class="pagenum">[386]</span><a name="link386" id="link386"></a>prettier
      or has more innocent ways; with the charming white and yellow sedum, it
      enlivens the long walls of stone, and both live on dryness, as other
      things on moisture.
    </p>

      The sun, the light, the vegetation, animals, man, are so many books
      wherein Nature has, in different characters, written the same thought. If
      the hogs have a clean and rosy skin, it is because the boiling granite and
      the sea swarming with fish have during millions of years accumulated and
      uplifted ten thousand feet of rock.

      some old story of the country, as, for example, the following:&mdash;

    <p>
      Bos de Bénac was a good knight, a great friend of the king Saint Louis; he
      went on a crusade into the land of Egypt, and killed many Saracens for
      <span class="pagenum">[390]</span><a name="link390" id="link390"></a>the
      salvation of his soul. But finally the French were beaten in a great
      battle, and Bos de Bénac left for dead. He was taken away prisoner along
      the river, towards the south, into a country where the skin of the men was
      quite burned by the heat, and there he remained ten years. They made him
      herdsman of their flocks, and often beat him because he was a Frank and a
      Christian.

    </h4>
    <p>
      One day when he was afflicted and lamenting his lot in a solitary place,
      he saw appear before him a little black man, who had two horns to his
      forehead, a goat&rsquo;s foot, and a more wicked air than <span
      class="pagenum">[391]</span><a name="link391" id="link391"></a>the most
      wicked of Saracens. Bos was so used to seeing black men, that he did not
      make the sign of the cross. It was the devil, who said, sneering, to him:
      &ldquo;Bos, what good has it done thee to fight for thy God? He leaves
      thee the servant of my servants of Nubia; the dogs of thy castle are
      better treated than thou. Thou art thought dead and tomorrow thy wife will
      be married. Go then to milk thy flock, thou good knight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bos uttered a loud cry and wept, for he loved his wife; the devil
      pretended to have pity on him, and said to him: &ldquo;I am not so bad as
      thy priests tell. Thou hast fought well; I like brave men; I will do for
      thee more than thy friend, the crucified one. This night shalt thou be in
      thy beautiful land of Bigorre. Give me in exchange a plate of nuts from
      thy table: what, there thou art embarrassed as a theologian! Dost thou
      think that nuts have souls? Come, decide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bos forgot that it is a mortal sin to give anything to the devil, and
      stretched out to him his hand. Immediately he was borne away as in a
      whirlwind; he saw beneath him a great yellow river, the Nile, which
      stretched out, like a snake, between two bands of sand; a moment
      afterward, a city spread on the strand like a cuirass; then innumerable
      waves ranged from one end of the horizon to the other, and on them black
      vessels <span class="pagenum">[392]</span><a name="link392" id="link392"></a>like
      unto swallows; further on, a triple-coasted island, with a hollow mountain
      full of fire and a plume of tawny smoke; then again the sea. Night fell,
      when a range of mountains lifted itself into the red bands of the sunset.
      Bos recognized the serrate tops of the Pyrenees and was filled with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil said to him: &ldquo;Bos, come first to my servants of the
      mountain. In all conscience, since you return to the country, you owe them
      a visit. They are more beautiful than thy angels, and will love thee,
      since thou art my friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The good knight was horrified to think that he was the friend of the
      devil, and followed him reluctantly. The hand of the devil was as a vice;
      he went swifter than the wind. Bos traversed at a bound the valley of
      Pierrefitte and found himself at the foot of the Bergonz, before a door of
      stone which he had never seen. The door opened of itself with a sound
      softer than a bird&rsquo;s song, and they entered a hall a thousand feet
      high, all of crystal, flaming as if the sun were inside it. Bos saw three
      little women as large as one&rsquo;s hand, on seats of agate; they had
      eyes clear as the green waters of the Gave; their cheeks had the vermilion
      of the thornless rose; their snowy robe was as light as the airy mist of
      the cascades; their scarf was of the hues of the rainbow. Bos believed he
      had seen it formerly floating on the brink of the <span class="pagenum">[393]</span><a
      name="link393" id="link393"></a>precipices, when the morning fog
      evaporated with the sun&rsquo;s first rays. They were spinning, and their
      wheels turned so fast that they were invisible. They rose all together,
      and sang with their little silvery voices: &ldquo;Bos is returned; Bos is
      the friend of our master; Bos, we will spin thee a cloak of silk in
      exchange for thy crusader&rsquo;s mantle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he was before another mountain, which he recognized by the
      light of the stars. It was that of Campana, which rings when misfortune
      comes upon the country. Bos found himself inside without knowing how it
      happened, and saw that it was hollow to the very summit. An enormous bell
      of burnished silver descended from the uppermost vault; a troop of black
      goats was attached to the clapper. Bos perceived that these goats were
      devils; their short tails wriggled convulsively; their eyes were like
      burning coals; their hair trembled and shrivelled like green branches on
      live coals; their horns were pointed and crooked like Syrian swords. When
      they saw Bos and the demon they came leaping around them with such abrupt
      bounds and such strange eyes that the good knight felt his heart fail
      within him. Those eyes formed cabalistic figures, and danced after the
      manner of the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp in the grave-yard; then they ranged
      themselves in single file and ran forward; the steel clapper flew against
      the sounding <span class="pagenum">[394]</span><a name="link394"
      id="link394"></a>wall, an immense voice came rolling forth from the
      vibrant silver. Bos seemed to hear it in the depths of his brain; the
      palpitations of the sound ran through his whole body; he shuddered with
      anguish like a man in delirium, and distinctly heard the bell chanting:
      &ldquo;Bos has returned; Bos is the friend of our master; Bos, it is not
      the bell of the church, it is I who ring thy return.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself once more lifted into the air; the trees rooted in the
      rock bent before his companion and himself as beneath a storm; the bears
      howled mournfully; troops of wolves fled shivering over the snow. Great
      reddish clouds flew across the sky, jagged and quivering like the wings of
      bats. The evil spirits of the valley rose up and eddied through the night.
      The heads of the rocks seemed alive; the army of the mountains appeared to
      shake themselves and follow him. They traversed a wall of clouds and
      stopped upon the peak of Anie. At that very moment, a flash cleft the
      vapory mass. Bos saw a phantom tall as a huge pine, the face burning like
      a furnace, enveloped in red clouds. Violet aureoles flamed upon his head;
      the lightning crept at his feet in dazzling trains; his whole body shone
      with white flashes. The thunder burst forth, the neighboring summit fell,
      the upturned rocks smoked, and Bos heard a mighty voice saying: &ldquo;Bos
      has returned; Bos is the friend of our <span class="pagenum">[395]</span><a
      name="link395" id="link395"></a>master; Bos, I illumine the valley for thy
      return better than the tapers of thy church.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The poor Bos, bathed in a cold sweat, was suddenly borne to the foot of
      the chateau of Bénac, and the devil said to him: &ldquo;Good knight, go
      now, find again thy wife!&rdquo; Then he began to laugh with a noise like
      the cracking of a tree, and disappeared, leaving behind a smell of
      sulphur. <span class="pagenum">[396]</span><a name="link396" id="link396"></a>

    </h4>
    <p>
      Morning dawned, the air was cold, the earth damp, and Bos shivered under
      his tatters, when he saw a superb cavalcade draw near. Ladies in robes of
      brocade seamed with silver and pearls; lords in armor of polished steel,
      with chains of gold; noble palfreys beneath scarlet housings, conducted by
      pages in doublets of black velvet; then an escort of men-at-arms, whose
      cuirasses glittered <span class="pagenum">[397]</span><a name="link397"
      id="link397"></a>in the sun. It was the Sire d&rsquo;Angles coming to
      marry the lady of Bénac. They filed slowly along the ascent and were
      buried beneath the darkness of the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bos ran to the gate; but they repelled him, saying: &ldquo;Come back at
      noon, my good man, thou shalt have alms like the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bos sat down upon a rock, tormented with grief and rage. Inside the castle
      he heard the flourish of trumpets and the sounds of rejoicing. Another was
      going to take his wife and his goods; he clenched his fists and revolved
      thoughts of murder; but he had no weapons; he determined to be patient, as
      he had so often been among the Saracens, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the poor of the neighborhood were gathered together, and Bos placed
      himself among them. He was not humble as the good king Saint Louis, who
      washed the feet of the beggars; he was heartily ashamed of walking among
      these pouch-bearers, these maimed and halt, with crooked legs and bent
      backs, ill clad in poor, torn and patched cloaks, and in rags and tatters;
      but he was still more ashamed when, in passing over the moat filled with
      clear water, he saw his burnt face, his locks bristling like the hair of a
      wild beast, his haggard eyes, his whole body wasted and bruised; then he
      remembered that his only garment was a torn sack <span class="pagenum">[398]</span><a
      name="link398" id="link398"></a>and the skin of a great goat, and that he
      was more hideous than the most hideous beggar. These cried aloud the
      praises of the wedded ones, while Bos ground his teeth with rage.

    <p>
      They followed the lofty corridor, and Bos saw through the door the old
      banqueting hall. His arms still hung there; he recognized the antlers of
      stags that he had shot with his bow, the heads of bears that he had slain
      with his bear-spear. The hall was full; the joy of the banquet rose high
      beneath the vault; the wine of Languedoc flowed generously in the cups,
      the guests were drinking the health of the betrothed. The lord of Angles
      was talking very low to the beautiful lady, who smiled and turned towards
      him her gentle eyes. <span class="pagenum">[399]</span><a name="link399"

    </p>
    <p>
      When Bos saw those rosy lips smiling and the black eyes beaming beneath
      the scarlet capulet, he felt his heart gnawed with jealousy, bounded into
      the hall and cried out with a terrible voice: &ldquo;Out of this, ye
      traitors! I am master here, Bos de Bénac.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beggar and liar!&rdquo; said the lord of Angles. &ldquo;We saw Bos
      fall dead on the banks of the Egyptian stream, Who art thou, old leper?
      Thy face is black like those of the damned Saracens. You are all in league
      with the devil; it is the evil spirit who has led thee hither. Drive him
      out, and loose the dogs upon him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the tender-hearted lady begged them to have mercy on the unhappy
      madman. Bos, pricked by his conscience, believing that everybody knew his
      sin, fled with his face in his hands, in horror of himself, and stayed not
      until he had reached a solitary bog. Night came, and the bell of Mount
      Campana began to toll. He heard the wheels of the faeries of the Bergonz
      humming. The giant clad in fire appeared on the peak of Anie. Strange
      images, like the dreams of a sick man, rose in his brain. The breath of
      the demon was on him. A legion of fantastic visages galloped through his
      head to the rustle of infernal wings, and the ravishing smile of the
      lovely lady pricked him to the heart like the point of a poniard. The
      little <span class="pagenum">[402]</span><a name="link402" id="link402"></a>black
      man appeared near him, and said to him: &ldquo;How, Bos, art thou not
      invited to the wedding of thy wife? The lord of Angles espouses her at
      this very hour. Friend Bos, he is not courteous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accursed of God, what art thou here to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art scarcely grateful; I have led thee out of Egypt, as Moses
      did his loafing Israelites, and I have transported thee, not in forty
      years but in a day, into the promised land. Poor fool, whose amusement is
      tears! Dost thou wish thy wife? Give me thy faith, nothing more. Indeed,
      thou art right; to-morrow, if thou art not frozen, and if thou pleadest
      humbly with the lord of Angles, he will make thee keeper of his kennels;
      it is a fine situation. To-night, sleep on the snow, good knight. Yonder,
      where the lights are, the lord of Angles embraces thy wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bos was stifling, and thought he was going to die. &ldquo;Oh Lord my God,&rdquo;
      said he, falling on his knees, &ldquo;deliver me from the tempter!&rdquo;
      And he burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil fled, driven by this ardent prayer; the hands of Bos clasped
      over his breast touched his marriage ring which he carried in his
      scapulary. He trembled with joy! &ldquo;Thanks, O Lord, and bring me there
      in time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran as if he had wings, crossed the threshold at a bound, and hid
      himself behind a pillar <span class="pagenum">[403]</span><a name="link403"
      id="link403"></a>of the gallery. The procession advanced with torches.
      When the lady was near him, Bos rose, took her hand and showed her the
      ring. She recognized it and threw herself into his arms. He turned towards
      those who were present and said: &ldquo;I have suffered like our Saviour,
      and like Him been denied. Men of Bigorre, who have maltreated and denied
      me, I pray that you will be my friends as of old.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow Bos went to pour a dish of nuts into a black gulf, where
      often was heard the voice of the devil; after that he left to confess
      himself to the pope. On his return he became a hermit in a cavern of the
      mountain, and his wife a nun in a convent at Tarbes. Both piously did
      penance, and were worthy after their death to behold God.

      A little beyond Lourdes begins the plain, and the sky opens out over an
      immense space: the azure dome grows pale toward the edges, and its tender
      blue, graded down by insensible shades, loses itself on the horizon in an
      exquisite whiteness. <span class="pagenum">[405]</span><a name="link405"
      id="link405"></a>These colors, so pure, so rich, so sweetly blended, are
      like a great concert where one finds himself enveloped in harmony; the
      light comes from all sides; the air is penetrated with it, the blue vault
      sparkles from the dome to the very horizon. Other objects are forgotten;
      you are absorbed in a single sensation; you cannot help enjoying this
      unchangeable serenity, this profusion of brightness, this overflowing of
      golden, gushing light playing in limitless space. This sky of the south
      corresponds to but one state of the soul, joy; it has but one thought, one
      beauty, but it gives rise to the conception of full and durable happiness;
      it sets in the heart a spring of gayety ever ready to flow; man in this
      country ought to wear life lightly. Our northern skies have a deeper and
      more varied expression; the metallic reflections of their changing clouds
      accord with the troubled souls; their broken light and strange shadings
      express the sad joy of melancholy passions they touch the heart more
      deeply and with a keener stroke. But blue and white are such lovely hues!
      From here the north seems an exile; you would never have thought that two
      colors could give so much pleasure. They vanish into each other, like
      pleasant sounds that grow into harmony and are blended together. The
      distant white softens the garish light and imprisons it in a haze of
      thickened <span class="pagenum">[406]</span><a name="link406" id="link406"></a>air.
      The azure of the dome deadens the rays under its dark tint, reflects them,
      breaks them, and seems strewn with spangles of gold. This glitter in the
      sky, these horizons drowned in a misty zone, this transparence of the
      infinite air, this depth of a heaven without clouds, is worth as much as
      the sight of the mountains.

      Tarbes is a good-sized city that looks like a market town, paved with
      small stones, mediocre in appearance. You alight in a place where great
      dusty elms make a shade. At noon the streets are empty; it is evident that
      you are near the sun of <span class="pagenum">[407]</span><a name="link407"
      id="link407"></a>Spain. A few women merely, with red foulards on the head,
      were selling peaches at the corners. A little further on some cavalry
      soldiers stretched their great awkward legs in the narrow shadow of their
      wall. You run across a square of four buildings, in the midst of which
      rises a bell-tower flaring at the base. It is the church; it has but a
      single aisle, very high, very broad, very cool, painted in dark colors,
      which contrast with the stifling heat outside and the glare of the white
      walls; above the altar, six columns of mottled marble, surmounted with a
      baldachin, make a pretty effect. The pictures are like those everywhere
      else: A Christ, mingled fresh butter and pale rose in hue, a passion in
      colored engravings at six sous each. A few, hung very high in dark
      corners, seem better because you can make nothing out of them. A little
      further on they have just built a court-house, clean and new as a judge&rsquo;s
      robe; the ashler work is well dressed, and the walls perfectly scraped.
      The front is adorned with two statues: Justice, who looks like a fool, and
      Force, who looks like a girl. Force has on low boots and the skin of an
      animal. Instead of fine statues we have ugly riddles. Since they had a
      fancy for symbols, could they not have dressed Force as a policeman? To
      compensate ourselves for the statues, we went to visit the horses. In this
      place, the homely city becomes an elegant city. <span class="pagenum">[408]</span><a
      name="link408" id="link408"></a>The buildings of the stud are simple and
      in good taste. Turf, rosebushes, stairways filled with flowers, a
      beautiful meadow of high grass; in the distance are poplars ranged as a
      screen to the limpid horizon. The habitation of the horses is a
      pleasure-house. There are fifty beasts in a long stable that might serve
      at need for a ball-room; they are superb creatures with shining coats,
      firm croup, gentle eye, calm front: they feed peaceably in their stalls,
      having a double mat under their litter; everything is brushed, wiped,
      rubbed. Grooms in red vests come and go incessantly to clean them and see
      that nothing is wanting. Man in the earthly paradise was less happy.

      Poor mankind has no city which is not full of lamentable memories. The
      Protestants took this one in 1570 and butchered all the inhabitants. One
      of them had taken refuge in a tower whose only ascent was by a narrow
      staircase; they sent one of his friends, who called to him under pretext
      of a parley; no sooner had he put his head at the window than he was
      killed by an arquebusade. The peasants who came to give burial to the dead
      interred two thousand of them in the <span class="pagenum">[409]</span><a
      name="link409" id="link409"></a>ditches. Five years after, the country was
      almost a desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patience! the Catholics were no gentler than the Protestants; witness that
      siege of Rabastens, twelve miles distant from Tarbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly,&rdquo; says Montluc, &ldquo;I saw that others besides our
      foot soldiers should have a hand here, and said to the nobility: &lsquo;Gentlemen,
      my friends, follow boldly, and give, and be not wonder-struck; for we
      could not choose a more honorable death.&rsquo; And so we all marched with
      as good a will as ever I saw in my life to the assault, and I twice looked
      back; I saw that all were closed up so as to touch one another. I had
      caused three or four ladders to be carried to the brink of the moat, and
      as I turned backward to order them to bring up two ladders, a volley was
      given me in the face from the corner of a barricade which adjoined the
      tower. I was suddenly covered with blood, for I bled from the mouth, nose
      and eyes. Then almost all the soldiers, and nearly all the nobles too,
      began to be affrighted and would retreat. But I cried out to them,
      although I could scarcely speak for the quantity of blood which gushed
      from my mouth and nose: 'Where will you go? Will you be frightened on my
      account? Do not stir, and do not abandon the fight.&rsquo; And said to the
      nobles, &lsquo;I am going to get my wounds dressed: let no one follow
      <span class="pagenum">[410]</span><a name="link410" id="link410"></a>me,
      and avenge me as you love me.&rsquo; I took a nobleman by the hand, and so
      was led to my lodging, where I found a surgeon of M. de Goas&rsquo;
      regiment, named Maître Simon, who dressed my wound and pulled out the
      bones from both cheeks with his two fingers, so large were the holes, and
      cut off much flesh from my face, which was covered with wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here now is M. de Madaillan, my lieutenant, who was at my side when
      I went to the charge, and M. de Goas on the other, who was come to see if
      I were dead, and said to me: &lsquo;Rejoice, monsieur, take courage, we
      are inside. There are the soldiers with hands that kill everybody; be
      assured then that we will avenge your wound.&rsquo; Then I said to him:
      &lsquo;I praise God, because I see that victory is ours before I die. At
      present I feel no concern at dying. I beg you will go back, and show me
      all the affection you have borne me, <i>and take care that no one escapes
      unkilled.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And immediately he went away, and even my servants all went; so
      that there remained along with me only two pages, and the advocate de Las
      and the surgeon. They wanted to save the minister and the captain of the
      garrison, named Ladous, so as to have them hung before my quarters. But
      the soldiers had nearly killed them themselves, and took them away from
      those who held them and tore <span class="pagenum">[411]</span><a
      name="link411" id="link411"></a>them into a thousand pieces. The soldiers
      made fifty or sixty who had withdrawn into the great tower, leap from the
      top into the moat, and these were drowned. It turns out that two who had
      hidden themselves were saved. There was a certain prisoner who wanted to
      give four thousand crowns. But never a man would hear of any ransom, and
      most of the women were killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With such fits of madness how has the human race managed to endure?
      &ldquo;In vain you drain it,&rdquo; says Mephistopheles, &ldquo;the fresh
      spring of living blood forever reappears.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II. BAGNÈRES-DE-BIGORRE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ou set out for
      Bagnères at five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, in the dust and amidst a
      train of <i>coucous</i> laden with people. The road is blocked, like the
      roads in the suburbs of Paris on a Saturday evening. The diligence, in
      passing, takes up as many peasants as it meets; they are put in heaps
      under the tilt, among the trunks, alongside the dogs; they seem proud and
      pleased with their lofty place. Legs, arms and heads, dispose themselves
      as best they can; they sing, and the coach appears like a music-box. It is
      in this triumphal equipage that you reach Bagnères, after sunset. You dine
      in haste, are taken to the <i>Promenade des Coustous</i>, and find, to
      your utter surprise, the Boulevard de Gand among the Pyrenees. <span
      class="pagenum">[413]</span><a name="link413" id="link413"></a>Four rows
      of dusty trees; regular benches at equal intervals; on both sides, hotels
      of modern aspect, one of which is occupied by M. de Rothschild; rows of
      illuminated shops, of cafés chantants surrounded by crowds; terraces
      filled with seated spectators; upon the roadway, a black throng streaming
      under the lights. Such is the spectacle beneath your eyes. The groups
      form, dissolve, close up; you follow the crowd; you learn again the art of
      getting on without stepping on the feet of those you meet, of grazing
      everybody without elbowing anybody; of not getting crushed and of not
      crushing others; in short, all the talents taught by civilization and the
      asphaltum. You meet again with the rustle of dresses, the confused hum of
      conversations and steps, the offensive splendor of artificial lights, the
      obsequious and wearied faces of traffic, the skilful display of the shops,
      and all the sensations you wanted to leave behind. Bagnères-de-Bigorre and
      Luchon are in the Pyrenees the capitals of polite life, the meeting place
      of the pleasures of the world and of fashion&mdash;Paris, six hundred
      miles away from Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, in the sunlight, the aspect of the city is charming.
      Great alleys of old trees cross it in every direction. Little gardens
      bloom upon the terraces. The Adour rolls along by the houses. Two streets
      are islands connected with <span class="pagenum">[414]</span><a
      name="link414" id="link414"></a>the highway by bridges laden with
      oleanders, and their green windows are mirrored in the clear wave.
      Streamlets of limpid water run from all the open places and all the
      streets; they cross, dive under ground, reappear, and the city is filled
      with their murmurs, their coolness, and their gayety. A little girl,
      seated upon a slab of slate, bathes her feet in the current; the cold
      water reddens them, and the poor little thing tucks up her worn gown with
      great care, for fear of wetting it. A woman on her knees is washing linen
      at her door; another bends over and draws water for her saucepan. The two
      black and shining trenches hedge in the white road, like two bands of jet.
      In the inner court or in the vestibule of each house the assembled women
      sew and spin, some on the steps of the stairway, others at the feet of a
      ville; they are in the shade, but on the crest of the wall the beautiful
      green leaves are traversed by a ray of sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the neighboring place, some men ranged in two lines were threshing
      wheat with long poles and heaping up masses of golden grain. Under its
      borrowed luxury the city preserves some rustic customs; but the rich light
      blends the contrasts, and the threshing of the wheat has the splendor of a
      ball. Further on are some buildings where the stream works the marbles.
      Slabs, blocks, piles of chips, shapeless material, fill the court for a
      length <span class="pagenum">[415]</span><a name="link415" id="link415"></a>of
      three hundred paces, among clusters of rosebushes, flowery borders,
      statues, and kiosks. In the workshops, heavy gearings, troughs of muddy
      water, rusty saws, huge wheels&mdash;these are the workmen. In the
      storerooms, columns, capitals of an admirable polish, white chimney-pieces
      bordered with leaves in relief, carved vases, sculptured basins, trinkets
      of agate&mdash;that is the work. The quarries of the Pyrenees have, all of
      them, given a specimen to panel the walls; it is a library of marbles.
      There are white ones like alabaster, rosy like living flesh, brown
      speckled like a guinea fowl&rsquo;s breast&mdash;the Griotte is of a
      blood-red. The black Baudéan, veined with white threads, emits a greenish
      reflection. The Ronce de Bise furrows its fawn-colored dress with dark
      bands. The grayish Sarrancolin has a peculiar glitter, is marked all over
      with scales, striped with pale tints, and stained with a broad blood-red
      spot. Nature is the greatest of painters; her infiltrations and
      subterranean fires could alone have invented this profusion of shades and
      patterns: it needed the audacious originality of chance and the slow toil
      of the mineral forces, to turn lines so capricious and assort tints so
      complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stream of swift water rolls beneath the workshops; another glides in
      front of the house, in a lovely meadow, under a screen of poplars. In the
      <span class="pagenum">[416]</span><a name="link416" id="link416"></a>pale
      distance you see the mountains. It is a fortunate spot considering that it
      is a sawer of stone.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The bathing-house is a beautiful white building, vast and regular; the
      long front, quite unornamented, is of a very simple form. This
      architecture, akin to the antique, is more beautiful in the south than in
      the north; like the sky, it leaves in the mind an impression of serenity
      and grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half of the river washes the façade, and precipitates under the entrance
      bridge its black sheet bristling with sparkling waves. You enter into a
      great vestibule, follow a huge staircase with double balustrade, then
      corridors ending in noble porticos and commanding the terraces. Bathing
      rooms panelled with marble, a verdant garden, fine points of view
      everywhere, high vaults, coolness, simple forms, soft hues that rest the
      eye and contrast with the crude, dazzling light, that out of doors falls
      on the dusty place and the white houses; all attracts, and it is a
      pleasure to be ill here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Romans, a people as civilized and as bored as we, did as we do, and
      came to Bagnères. The inhabitants of the country, good courtiers,
      constructed, on the public place, a temple in honor of Augustus. The
      temple became a church that was <span class="pagenum">[417]</span><a
      name="link417" id="link417"></a>dedicated to St. Martin, but retained the
      pagan inscription. In 1641, they removed the inscription to above the
      fountain of the southern entrance, where it still is.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1823, they discovered on the site of the bathhouse, columns, capitals,
      four piscinæ cased with marbles and adorned with mouldings, and a large
      number of medals with effigies of the first Roman emperors. These remains,
      found after a lapse of eighteen centuries, leave a deep impression, like
      that one experiences in measuring the great limestone beds, antediluvian
      sepulchres of buried races. Our cities are founded upon the ruins of
      extinct civilizations, and our fields on the remains of subverted
      creations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome has left its trace everywhere at Bagnères. The most agreeable of
      these souvenirs of antiquity are the monuments which those who had been
      healed erected in honor of the Nymphs, and whose inscriptions still
      remain. Lying in the <i>baignoires</i> of marble, they felt the virtue of
      the beneficent goddess penetrating their limbs; with eyes half-closed,
      dozing in the soft embrace of the tepid water, they heard the mysterious
      spring dripping, dripping with a song, from the recesses of the rock, its
      mother; the outpoured sheet shone about them with dim, greenish reflexes,
      and before them passed like a vision the strange eye and magic voice of
      the <span class="pagenum">[418]</span><a name="link418" id="link418"></a>unknown
      divinity, who came to the light in order to bring health to hapless
      mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the bath-house is a high hill, covered with admirable trees, where
      wind sequestered walks. Thence you see under your feet the city, whose
      slated roofs reflect the powerful light of the burning sky and stand out
      in the limpid air with a tawny and leaden hue. A line of poplars marks on
      the great green plain the course of the river; towards Tarbes it strikes
      endlessly into the vaporous distance, amidst tender hues. Opposite, wooded
      and cultivated hills rise, round-topped, to the very horizon. On the
      right, the mountains, like so many pyramids, descend in long regular
      quoins. These hills and mountains cut out a sinuous line on the radiant
      border of the sky. From the white and smiling horizon, the eye mounts by
      insensible shades to the deep burning blue of the dome. This whiteness
      imparts a tender and delicious sensation, mingling of revery and pleasure;
      it touches, troubles and delights, like the song of Cherubino in Mozart. A
      fresh wind comes from the valley; the body is as comfortable as the mind;
      one finds in his nature a harmony hitherto unknown; he no longer bears the
      weight of his thought or of his mechanism; he does nothing but feel; he
      becomes thoroughly animal, that is to say, perfectly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening we walk in the plain. There are <span class="pagenum">[419]</span><a
      name="link419" id="link419"></a>in the fields of maize retired paths where
      one is alone. The tops, seven feet high, form, as it were, a copse of
      trees. The great sheaf of green leaves ends in slender little columns of
      rosy grains, and the slanting sun slips its arrows of gold among the
      stalks. You find meadows cut by streams which the peasants dam up, and
      which, for several hours, overflow to refresh the fields. The day
      declines, the huge shadow of the mountains darkens the verdure; clouds of
      insects hum in the heavy air. The whisper of an expiring breeze makes the
      leaves to shiver for a moment. Meanwhile the carriages and the cavalcades
      return on all the roads, and the courts are illuminated for the evening
      promenade.

      CHAPTER III. THE PEOPLE.

    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>verybody agrees
      that life at watering-places is very poetic, abounding in adventures of
      every sort, especially adventures of the heart. Read the novels <i>L&rsquo;Anneau
      d&rsquo;Argent</i> of Charles de Bernard, George Sand&rsquo;s <i>Lavinia</i>,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      If watering-place life is a romance, it is in the books that it is so. To
      see great men in these places, you must carry them bound in calf in your
      trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is equally agreed that conversation at watering-places is extremely
      brilliant, that you meet only artists, superior men, people of the great
      world; that ideas, grace and elegance are lavished there, and that the
      flower of all pleasures and all thought there comes into bloom. <span
      class="pagenum">[421]</span><a name="link421" id="link421"></a>The truth
      is that you use up a great many hats, eat a great many peaches, say a
      great many words, and, in the matter of men and of ideas, you find very
      much what you find elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the catalogue of a <i>salon</i> better made up than many another:
    </p>
    <p>
      An old nobleman, somewhat resembling Balzac&rsquo;s M. de Mortsauf, an
      officer previous to 1830, very brave, and capable of reasoning exactly,
      when he was hard pushed. He had a great long cartilaginous neck, that
      turned all together and with difficulty, like a rusty machine; his feet
      shook about in his square-toed shoes; the skirts of his frock-coat hung
      like flags about his legs. His body and his clothes were stiff, awkward,
      old-fashioned and scant, like his opinions; a dotard, moreover,
      fastidious, peevish, busy all day long in sifting over nothings and
      complaining about trifles; he pestered his servant a whole hour about a
      grain of dust overlooked on the skirt of his coat, explaining the method
      of removing dust, the danger of leaving dust, the defects of a negligent
      spirit, the merits of a diligent spirit, with so much monotony and
      tenacity and so slowly, that at last one stopped up one&rsquo;s ears or
      went to sleep. He took snuff, rested his chin on his cane, and looked
      straight ahead with the torpid, dull expression of a mummy. Rustic life,
      the want of conversation and action, the fixedness <span class="pagenum">[422]</span><a
      name="link422" id="link422"></a>of mechanical habits, had extinguished
      him.
    </p>

    <h4>
      <a href="images/448.jpg"><i>FULL-SIZE</i></a> -- <a href="images/448m.jpg"><i>Medium-Size</i></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Beside him sat an English girl and her mother. The young woman had not
      succeeded in extinguishing herself, she was frozen at her birth; however,
      she was motionless as he. She carried a jeweller&rsquo;s shop on her arms,
      bracelets, chains, of every form and all metals, which hung and jingled
      like little bells. The mother was one of those hooked stalks of asparagus,
      knobby, stuck into a swelling gown, such as can flourish and come to seed
      only amidst the fogs of London. They took tea and only talked with each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third place one remarked a very noble young man, dressed to
      perfection, curled every day, with soft hands, forever washed, brushed,
      adorned and beautified, and handsome as a doll. His was a formal and
      serious self-conceit. His least actions were of an admirable correctness
      and <span class="pagenum">[423]</span><a name="link423" id="link423"></a>gravity.
      He weighed every word when he asked for soup. He put on his gloves with
      the air of a Roman emperor. He never laughed; in his calm gestures you
      recognized a man penetrated with self-respect, who raises
      conventionalities into principles. His complexion, his hands, his beard,
      and his mind, had been so scoured, rubbed, and perfumed by etiquette, that
      they seemed artificial.

    <p>
      Ordinarily he gave the cues to a Moldavian lady, who kept the conversation
      alive. This lady had travelled all over Europe, and related her travels in
      such a piercing and metallic voice, that you wondered if she had not a
      clarion somewhere in her body. She held forth unassisted, sometimes for a
      quarter of an hour together, principally about rice and the degree of
      civilization among the Turks, on the barbarism of the Russian generals,
      and on the baths of Constantinople. Her well-filled memory only overflowed
      in tirades: it was almost as amusing as a gazetteer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near her was a pale, slender, meagre Spaniard, with a face like a
      knife-blade. We knew, by some <span class="pagenum">[424]</span><a
      name="link424" id="link424"></a>words he let fall, that he was rich and a
      republican. He spent his life with a newspaper in his hand,&mdash;he read
      twelve or fifteen of them in a day, with little dry, jerking movements,
      and nervous contractions that passed over his face like a shiver. He sat
      habitually in a corner, and you saw gleaming in his countenance feeble
      desires of proclamations and professions of faith. In the very same moment
      his glance died away like a too sudden fire that blazes up and falls
      again. He only spoke in monosyllables, and to ask for tea. His wife knew
      no French, and sat all the evening motionless in her arm-chair.

    </h4>
    <p>
      Must we speak of an old lady from Saumur, a frequenter of the baths,
      watchful of the heat, the cold, the currents of air, the seasoning,
      determined not to enrich her heirs any sooner than it was necessary, who
      trotted about all day, and played with her dog in the evening? Of an abbé
      and his pupil, who dined apart, to escape the contagion of worldly
      conversation? etc. The truth is that there is nothing to paint, and that
      in the next restaurant you will see the same people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in good faith, what can be the conversation in such a society? As the
      answer is important, I <span class="pagenum">[425]</span><a name="link425"
      id="link425"></a>beg the reader to run over the subjoined classification
      of interesting conversations; he will judge for himself as to the
      likelihood of meeting at a watering-place with anything similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      First sort: Circumlocutions, oratorical argumentation, exordiums full of
      insinuation, smiles and bows, which may be translated by the following
      phrase: &ldquo;Monsieur, help me to make a thousand francs.&rdquo; Second
      sort: Periphrases, metaphysical disquisitions, the voice of the soul,
      gestures and genuflexions, ending in this phrase: &ldquo;Madame, allow me
      to be your very humble servant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Third sort: Two persons who have need of each other are together; abstract
      of their conversation: &ldquo;You are a great man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so are you.&rdquo; Fourth sort: You are seated at the fireside
      with an old friend; you stir up the embers and talk of&mdash;no matter
      what, for instance: &ldquo;Would you like some tea? My cigar is out.&rdquo;
      Or, what is better, you say nothing at all, and listen to the singing of
      the tea-kettle; all actions, which mean: &ldquo;You are a good fellow, and
      would do me a service in case of need.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifth sort: New general ideas and freely expressed; sort lost sight of
      these hundred years. It was known in the salons of the eighteenth century;
      genus to-day fossil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixth, and last sort: Discharges of wit, fireworks <span class="pagenum">[426]</span><a
      name="link426" id="link426"></a>of brilliant speeches, images struck out,
      colors displayed, profusion of animation, originality and gayety. A sort
      infinitely rare and diminished every day, by the fear of compromising one&rsquo;s
      self, by the important air, by the affectation of morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      These six sorts wanting&mdash;and they are evidently wanting&mdash;what
      remains? Conversation such as Henri Monnier paints, and M. Prudhomme
      makes. Only the manners here are better; for instance, we know that we
      ought to help ourselves last to soup, and first to salad; we are provided
      with certain proper phrases which we exchange for other proper phrases; we
      answer to an anticipated motion by an anticipated motion, after the
      fashion of the Chinese; we come to yawn inwardly and smile outwardly, in
      company and in state. This comedy of affectations and the commerce of <i>ennui</i>
      form the conversation at the springs and elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly many people go to take the air in the streets.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The street is full of downcast faces; lawyers, bankers, people tired with
      office work, or bored with having too much fortune and too little trouble.
      In the evening, they go to Frascati or watch the loungers who elbow each
      other among the shops <span class="pagenum">[427]</span><a name="link427"
      id="link427"></a>on the course. During the day they drink and bathe a
      little, ride and smoke a good deal. The bloated patients, stretched on
      arm-chairs, digest their food; the lean study the newspapers; the young
      men talk with the ladies about the weather; the ladies are busy in
      rounding their petticoats aright: the old, who are critics and
      philosophers, take snuff, or look at the mountains with glasses, to
      ascertain if the engravings are exact. It is not worth the trouble of
      having so much money, merely to have so little pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <i>ennui</i> proves that life resembles the opera; to be happy there,
      you must have money for your ticket, but, also, the sentiment of music. If
      the money is wanting, you remain outside in the rain among the
      boot-blacks; if you have no taste for music, you sleep sullenly in your
      superb box. I conclude that we must try to earn the four francs for the
      parterre, but above all to make ourselves acquainted with music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promenades are too neat and recall the Bois de Boulogne; here and
      there a tired broom leans against a tree its slanting silhouette. From the
      depths of a thicket the <i>sergents de ville</i> cast on you their eagle
      glance, and the dung decorates the alleys with its poetic heaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      An invalid always brings with him one or more <span class="pagenum">[428]</span><a
      name="link428" id="link428"></a>companions. Where is the being so
      disinherited by heaven as not to have a relation or friend who is bored?
      And where is the friend or relation so thankless as to refuse a service
      which is a pleasure party? The invalid drinks and bathes; the friend wears
      gaiters or rides, hence the species of tourists.

    </h4>
    <p>
      This species comprises several varieties, which are distinguished by the
      song, the plumage, and the gait. These are the principal:
    </p>
    <h3>
      FIRST.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first has long legs, lean body, head bent <span class="pagenum">[429]</span><a
      name="link429" id="link429"></a>forward, large and powerful feet, vigorous
      hands, excellent at grasping and holding on. It is provided with canes,
      ferruled sticks, umbrellas, cloaks, india-rubber top-coats. It despises
      dress, shows itself but little in society, knows thoroughly guides and
      hotels. It strides over the ground in an admirable manner, rides with
      saddle, without saddle, in every way and all possible beasts. It walks for
      the sake of walking, and to have the right of repeating several fine,
      ready-made phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found, and picked up, at Eaux-Chaudes, the journal of one of these
      walking tourists. It is entitled: <i>My Impressions</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;15th July.&mdash;Ascent of Vignemale. Set out at midnight, came
      back at ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening. Appetite on the summit;
      excellent dinner, pate, fowls, trout, claret, kirsch. My horse stumbled
      eleven times. Feet galled. Rondo, good guide. Total: sixty-seven francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;20th July.&mdash;Ascent of the Pic du Midi de Bigorre. Fifteen
      hours. Sanio, fair guide; knows neither songs nor stories. Good sleep for
      an hour at the top. Two bottles broken, which rather spoiled the
      provisions. Thirty-eight francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;21st July.&mdash;Excursion to the Valley of Héas. Too many stones
      in the road. Twenty-one miles. Must exercise every day. To-morrow will
      walk twenty-four. <span class="pagenum">[430]</span><a name="link430"
      id="link430"></a>"24th July.&mdash;Excursion to the Valley of Aspe.
      Twenty-seven miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1st August.&mdash;Lake of Oo. Good water, very cold; the bottles
      were well cooled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;2d August.&mdash;Valley of the Arboust. Met three caravans; two of
      donkeys, one of horses. Thirty miles. Throat raw. Corns on the feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;3d August.&mdash;Ascent of the Maladetta. Three days. Sleep at the
      Rencluse de la Maladetta. My large double cloak with the fur collar keeps
      me from being frozen. In the morning I make the omelette myself. Punch
      with snow. Second night in the Vale of Malibierne. Passage of the Glacier.
      My right shoe gets torn. Arrival at the summit. View of three bottles left
      by the preceding tourists. For amusement, I read a number of the <i>Journal
      des Chasseurs</i>. On my return, I am entertained by the guides. Bagpipes
      in the evening at my door; great bouquet with a ribbon. Total: one hundred
      and sixty-eight francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;15th August.&mdash;Leave the Pyrenees. Three hundred and ninety-one
      leagues in a month, on foot as well as on horse and in carriage. Eleven
      ascents, eighteen excursions. I have used up two ferruled sticks, a
      top-coat, three pairs of trousers, five pairs of shoes. Good year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Sublime country. My spirit bows beneath these great
      emotions.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[431]</span><a name="link431"

    <h3>
      SECOND.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The second variety comprises thoughtful methodical people, generally
      wearing spectacles, endowed with a passionate confidence in the printed
      letter. You know them by the guide-book, which they always carry in their
      hand. This book is to them the law and the prophets. They eat trout at the
      place named in the book, make all the stops advised by the book, dispute
      with the innkeeper when he asks more than is marked in the book. You see
      them at the remarkable points with their eyes fixed on the book, filling
      themselves with the description, and informing themselves exactly of the
      sort of emotion which it is proper to feel. On the eve of an excursion,
      they study the book and learn in advance the order and connection of the
      sensations they ought to experience: first, surprise; a little further on
      a tender impression; three miles beyond, chilled with horror; finally a
      calm sensibility. They do and feel nothing but with documents in hand and
      on good authority. On reaching a hotel, their first care is to ask their
      neighbor at the table if there is any place of reunion; at what hour
      people meet there; how the different hours of the day are filled up; what
      walk is taken in the afternoon; what other in the evening. The next <span
      class="pagenum">[434]</span><a name="link434" id="link434"></a>day they
      follow all these directions conscientiously. They are clad in
      watering-place fashion; they change their dress as many times as the
      custom of the places deems proper; they make all the excursions they ought
      to make at the necessary hour, in the proper equipage. Have they any
      taste? It is impossible to say; the book and public opinion have thought
      and decided for them. They have the consolation of thinking that they have
      walked in the broad road and are imitators of the human kind. These are
      the <i>docile tourists.</i>

      You see from afar a great <span class="pagenum">[435]</span><a
      name="link435" id="link435"></a>peaceable cavalcade; father, mother, two
      daughters, two tall cousins, one or two friends and sometimes donkeys for

      They beat the donkeys, which are restive; they advise the fiery youths to
      be prudent; a glance retains the young ladies about the green veil of the
      mother. The distinctive traits of this variety are the green veil, the
      bourgeois spirit, the love of siestas and meals on the grass; an unfailing
      sign is the taste for little social games. This variety is rare at
      Eaux-Bonnes, more common at Bagnères de Bigorre and at Bagnères de Luchon.
      It is remarkable for its prudence, its culinary instincts, its economical
      habits. The individuals making the excursion stop at a spot selected the
      day before; they unload pâtés and bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they have brought nothing, they go and knock at the nearest hut for
      milk; they are astonished at having to pay three sous a glass for it: they
      find that it strongly resembles goat&rsquo;s milk, and they say to each
      other, after they have drunken, that the wooden spoon was not over-clean.
      They <span class="pagenum">[436]</span><a name="link436" id="link436"></a>look
      curiously at the dark stable, half underground, where the cows ruminate on
      beds of heather; after which, the great fat men seat themselves or lie
      down. The artist of the family draws out his album and copies a bridge, a
      mill, and other album views. The young girls run and laugh, and let
      themselves drop out of breath upon the grass; the young men run after
      them. This variety, indigenous in the great cities, in Paris above all,
      wishes to revive among the Pyrenees the pleasure parties of Meudon or
      Montmorency.

      Fourth kind: dining tourists. At Louvie, a family from Carcassonne,
      father, mother, son, daughter and servant, alighted from the interior. For
      the first time in their life they were undertaking a <span class="pagenum">[437]</span><a
      name="link437" id="link437"></a>pleasure trip. The father was one of those
      florid bourgeois, pot-bellied, important, dogmatic, well-clad in fine
      cloth, carefully preserved, who educate their cooks, arrange their house
      <i>en bonbonnière</i>, and establish themselves in their comfort, like an
      oyster in its shell. They entered stupefied into a dark dining-room, where
      the half-empty bottles strayed among the cooling dishes. The cloth was
      soiled, the napkins of a doubtful white. The father, indignant, asked for
      a cup of tea, and began walking up and down with a tragic air. The rest
      looked at each other mournfully and sat down. The dishes came
      helter-skelter, all of them failures. Our Carcassonne friends helped
      themselves, turned the meat over on their plates, looked at it, and did
      not eat. They ordered tea a second time; the tea did not appear; the
      travellers were called for the coach, and the landlord demanded twelve
      francs. Without saying a word, with a gesture of concentrated horror, the
      head of the family paid. Then, approaching his wife, he said to her:
      &ldquo;It was your wish, madam!&rdquo; A quarter of an hour later the
      storm burst forth: he poured his complaint into the bosom of the
      conductor. He declared that the company would fail if it changed horses at
      such a poisoner&rsquo;s; he trusted that disease would soon carry off such
      dirty people. They told him that everybody in the country was so, and that
      they lived <span class="pagenum">[438]</span><a name="link438" id="link438"></a>happily
      for eighty years. He raised his eyes to heaven, repressed his grief, and
      directed his thoughts toward Carcassonne.

      One day, at the foot of a damp rock, I saw a little lean man coming toward
      me, with a nose like an eagle&rsquo;s beak; a hatchet face, green eyes,
      grizzling locks, nervous, jerky movements, and something quaint and
      earnest in his countenance. He had on huge gaiters, an old black,
      rain-beaten cap, trousers spattered to the knee with mud, a botanical case
      full of dents on his back, and in his <span class="pagenum">[439]</span><a
      name="link439" id="link439"></a>hand a small spade. Unfortunately I was
      looking at a plant with long, straight, green stalk, and white, delicate
      corolla, which grew near some hidden springs. He took me for a raw
      fellow-botanist. &ldquo;Ah, here you are, gathering plants! What, by the
      stalk, clumsy? What will it do in your herbarium without roots? Where is
      your case? your weeder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Common plant, frequent in the environs of Paris, <i>Parnassia
      palustris</i>: stem simple, erect, a foot in height, glabrous, radical
      leaves petiolate (sheathing caulis, sessile), cordiform, entirely
      glabrous; simple flower, white, terminal, the calix with lanceolate
      leaves, petals rounded, marked with hollow lines, nectaries ciliate and
      furnished with yellow globules at the extremity of the cilia resembling
      pistils; helleboraceous. Those nectaries are curious; good study, plant
      well chosen. Courage! you&rsquo;ll get on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am no botanist!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, you are modest. However, since you are in the Pyrenees,
      you must study the flora of the country; you will not find another such
      opportunity. There are rare-plants here which you should absolutely carry
      away. I gathered near Oleth, the Menziesra Daboeci, an inestimable
      godsend. I will show you at the house the <i>Ramondia</i> <span
      class="pagenum">[440]</span><a name="link440" id="link440"></a><i>Pyrenaica,</i>
      solanaceous with the aspect of the primrose. I scaled Mont Perdu to find
      the <i>Ranunculus parnassifolius</i> mentioned by Ramond, and which grows
      at a height of 2,700 mètres. Hah! what is that! the <i>Aquilcgia
      Pyrenaica!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And my little man started off like an isard, clambered up a slope,
      carefully dug the soil about the flower, took it up, without cutting a
      single root, and returned with sparkling eyes, triumphant air, and holding
      it aloft like a banner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plant peculiar to the Pyrenees. I have long wanted it; the specimen
      is excellent. Come, my young friend, a slight examination: you don&rsquo;t
      know the species, but you recognize the family?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! I don&rsquo;t know a word of botany.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me stupefied. &ldquo;And why do you gather plants?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see them, because they are pretty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his flower into his case, adjusted his cap, and went off without
      adding another word.

    <h3>
      SIXTH.

    <p>
      Sixth variety; very numerous: <i>sedentary tourists.</i> They gaze on the
      mountains from their windows; their excursions consist in going from their
      room to the English garden, from the English garden to the promenade. They
      take a siesta upon the heath, <span class="pagenum">[441]</span><a
      name="link441" id="link441"></a>and read the journal stretched on a chair;

    <h3>
      SEVENTH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was a grand ball yesterday. Paul presented there a young creole from
      Venezuela in America; the young man has as yet seen nothing; he has just
      left ship at Bordeaux, whence he comes here; a very fine fellow, however,
      of a fine, olive complexion; great hunter, and better fitted for
      frequenting mountains than drawing-rooms. He comes to France to form
      himself, as they say; Paul pretends that it is to be deformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have taken our place in a corner; and the young man has asked Paul to
      define to him a ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great funereal and penitential ceremony.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of it, and the custom goes back a long way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to Henry III. who instituted assemblies of flagellants. The
      men of the court bared their backs, and met together to lash one another
      over the shoulders. Nowadays there is no longer any whipping, but the
      sadness is the same. All the men who are here come to expiate great sins
      or have just lost their relations.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[442]</span><a
      name="link442" id="link442"></a>"That is the reason why they are dressed
      in black.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the ladies are in magnificent dresses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They mortify themselves only the better for that. Each one has hung
      around the loins a sort of haircloth, that horrible load of petticoats
      which hurts them and finally makes them ill. This is after the example of
      the saints, the better to work out salvation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all the men are smiling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the finest thing about it; cramped as they are, shut up in
      their winding-sheet of black cloth. They impose restraint on themselves,
      and give proof of virtue. Go forward six steps, you will see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man advanced; not yet used to the movements of a drawing-room,
      he stepped on the feet of a dancer and smashed the hat of a melancholy
      gentleman. He returned, covered with confusion, to hide himself beside us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did your two poor devils say to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t at all understand. The first, after an involuntary
      wry face, looked at me amiably. The other put his hat under his other arm
      and bowed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humility, resignation, a wish to suffer in order to enhance their
      merits. Under Henry III. they thanked him who had strapped them the best.
      I <span class="pagenum">[443]</span><a name="link443" id="link443"></a>will
      make a musician talk; listen. Monsieur Steuben, what quadrille are you
      playing there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;Enfer</i>, a fantastic quadrille. It is the legend of a
      young girl carried off alive in the clutches of the devil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very expressive. The finale expresses her cries of grief and the
      howling of the demons. The young girl makes the air, the demons the bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you play after that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some contra-dances on <i>di tanti palpiti.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you please give me the idea of that air.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at the return of Tancred. The point is to paint the most
      touching sadness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent choice. And no mazurkas, no waltzes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently; here is a great book of Chopin, he is our favorite. What
      a master! What fever! what cries, sorrowful, uncertain, broken! All these
      mazurkas make one want to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why they are danced; you see, my dear child, only afflicted
      people could select such music. By the way, how do they dance in your
      country?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With us? we jump and stir about, we laugh out, shout, perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What comical folks! and why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they are happy and want to stir their limbs."<span
      class="pagenum">[444]</span><a name="link444" id="link444"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, four steps forward, as many back, a turn cramped by the
      conflict of neighboring dresses, two or three geometric inclinations. The
      cotton-spinners in the prison at Poissy make precisely the same motions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these people talk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go forward and listen; there is nothing inconsiderate about it, I
      assure you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He returns after a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the man say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman came up briskly, smiled delicately, and, with a
      gesture as of a happy discoverer, he remarked that it was warm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady&rsquo;s eyes flashed. With an enchanting smile of
      approval, she answered that it was indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge what constraint they must have imposed on themselves. The
      gentleman is thirty years old; for twelve years he has known his phrase;
      the lady is twenty-two, she has known hers for seven years. Each has made
      and heard the question and answer three or four thousand times, and yet
      they appear to be interested, surprised. What empire over self! What force
      <span class="pagenum">[445]</span><a name="link445" id="link445"></a>of
      nature! You see clearly that these French who are called light are stoics
      on occasion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eyes smart, my feet are swollen, I have been swallowing dust; it
      is one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the air smells bad, I should like to
      go. Will they remain much longer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      EIGHTH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two days after there was a concert. The creole said in coming out that he
      was very tired, and had understood nothing of all that buzzing, and begged
      Paul to explain to him what pleasure people found in such noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they have enjoyed it, since they paid
      six francs for admission, and applauded vehemently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Music awakes all sorts of agreeable reveries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an air suggests scenes of love; such another makes you imagine
      great landscapes, tragic events.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t have these reveries, the music bores you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; unless you are professor of harmony.&rdquo; <span

    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that they have all had all those reveries you talk about,

      serenade mentioned in the programme, the serenade from Don Pasquale.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;It paints a happy love, full of pleasure and unconcern. You see a
      handsome youth with laughing eyes and blooming cheek, in a garden in
      Italy; under a tranquil moon, by the whispering of the breeze, he awaits
      his mistress, thinks of her smile, <span class="pagenum">[447]</span><a

    <p>
      &ldquo;I am getting confused. I, when I dream, want to be alone, at my
      ease, or at most with a friend. If music touches me, it is in a little
      dark room, when some one plays airs of one sort, that suit my state of
      mind. It is not necessary that any one should talk to me about positive
      things. Dreams do not come to me at will; they fly away in spite of me. I
      see clearly that I am on another continent, with an entirely different

      In the evening our creole, who had been thinking, said to Paul:

      &ldquo;One out of eight; of the other seven, three become good

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose for a compensation they are made to read?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le Ragois, La Harpe, and other dictionaries, all sorts of little
      treatises of florid piety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then is your education?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty case embalmed with incense, perfumed, securely padlocked,
      where the mind sleeps while the finders turn a bird-organ.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is encouraging for the husband. And what does <i>he</i>
      do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He receives the key of the case, opens it; a little devil in a
      white dress jumps at his nose, eager to dance and get out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, the husband serves as guide. Has he other cares?&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;It exalts and refines. Mendelssohn surrounds them with ardent,

      Paul has sprained his foot and spent two days in his room, occupied in
      watching a poultry yard. He improved the occasion by writing the following
      little treatise for the use of the young creole, a sort of viaticum, with
      which he will nourish himself for the better understanding of the world. I
      thought the treatise melancholy and skeptical. Paul replies, that one
      should be so at first, in order not to be afterward, and that it is well
      to be a little skeptical if you wish not to be too skeptical. <span

      LIFE AND PHILOSOPHICAL OPINIONS OF A CAT.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was born in a cask, at the back of a hay-loft: the light fell on my
      closed eyelids, so that the first eight days, everything appeared
      rose-colored to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eighth, it was still better; I looked, and saw a great fall of light
      upon the dark shade; the dust and insects danced in it. The hay was warm
      and fragrant; the spiders hung in sleep from the tiles; the gnats hummed;
      everything seemed happy; that emboldened me; I wanted to go and touch the
      white patch where those little diamonds were whirling and which rejoined
      the roof by a column of gold. I rolled over like a ball; my eyes were
      burned, my sides bruised; I was choking, and I coughed till nightfall.
      <span class="pagenum">[455]</span><a name="link455" id="link455"></a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When my paws had become firm, I went out and soon made friends with a
      goose, an estimable creature, for she had a warm belly; I cowered
      underneath, and during this time her philosophic conversation was forming
      me. She used to say that the poultry yard was a republic of allies; that
      the most industrious, man, had been chosen for chief, and that the dogs,
      although turbulent, were our guardians. I shed tears of emotion under my
      kind friend&rsquo;s belly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning the cook appeared looking as if butter would not melt in her
      mouth, and showing a handful of barley. The goose stretched forth her
      neck, which the cook grasped, drawing a big knife. My uncle, an active
      philosopher, ran up and began to exhort the goose, which was uttering
      indecorous cries: &ldquo;Dear sister,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the farmer,
      when he shall have eaten your flesh, will have a clearer intelligence, and
      will watch better over your welfare; and the dogs, nourished with your
      bones, will be the more capable of defending you.&rdquo; Thereupon the
      goose became silent, for her head was cut off, and a sort of red pipe
      stuck out beyond the bleeding neck. My uncle ran for the head and carried
      it nimbly away; as for me, a little frightened, I <span class="pagenum">[456]</span><a
      name="link456" id="link456"></a>drew near to the pool of blood, and,
      without thinking, I dipped my tongue into it; the blood was very good, and
      I went to the kitchen to see if I could not have some more of it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My uncle, a very old and experienced animal, taught me universal history.

    <p>
      At the beginning of things, when he was born, the master being dead, the
      children at the funeral and the servants at a dance, all the animals found
      themselves free. It was a frightful hubbub; a turkey, whose feathers were
      too fine, was stripped by his comrades. In the evening, a ferret, which
      had slipped in, sucked the jugular vein of three-quarters <span
      class="pagenum">[457]</span><a name="link457" id="link457"></a>of the
      combatants, who, naturally, made no further outcry. The spectacle in the
      farmyard was fine; here and there was a dog swallowing a duck; the horses
      in pure sportiveness were breaking the backs of the dogs; my uncle himself
      crunched a half-dozen little chickens. That was the golden age, said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when the people came home, the whipping began. Uncle
      received a lash which took off a strip of his fur. The dogs, well flogged
      and tied up, howled with repentance and licked the hands of their new
      master. The horses resumed their burden with administrative zeal. The
      fowls, protected, clucked their benedictions; only, six months after, when
      the dealer passed, they killed fifty at once. The geese, among whose
      number was my late kind friend, flapped their wings, saying that
      everything was in good order, and praising the farmer, the public
      benefactor.

    <p>
      My uncle, although surly, acknowledges that things are better than they
      used to be. He says that at first our race was savage, and that there are
      still in the woods cats who are like our first ancestors, which, at long
      intervals, catch a mole or dormouse, but oftener the contents of a
      shot-gun. <span class="pagenum">[458]</span><a name="link458" id="link458"></a>Others,
      lean, short-haired, run over the roofs and think that mice are very rare.
      As for us, brought up on the summit of earthly felicity, we whisk a
      flattering tail in the kitchen, we utter tender little mewings, we lick
      the empty plates, and at the utmost we put up with a dozen cuffs in the
      course of the day.

      Music is a heavenly art, and it is certain that our race has the privilege
      of it; it springs from the depths of our entrails; men know this so well
      that they borrow them from us when they want to imitate us with their
      violins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two things inspire in us these heavenly songs: the view of the stars and
      love. Men, clumsy copyists, cram themselves ridiculously into a low hall,
      and skip about thinking to equal us. It is on the summit of the roofs, in
      the splendor of the night, when all the skin shivers, that the divine
      melody can find vent. Out of jealousy they curse us and fling stones at
      us. Let them burst with rage. Never will their expressionless voice attain
      to those serious rumblings, those piercing notes, mad arabesques, inspired
      and unexpected fancies, which soften the soul of the most stubborn she,
      and give her over to us, all trembling, while up above the voluptuous
      stars twinkle and the moon grows pale with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      How happy is youth, and how hard it is to lose its holy illusions! And I
      too, I have loved and have haunted the roofs, modulating the while the
      roll of my bass. One of my cousins was touched thereby, and two months
      after brought into the world six pink and white kittens. I ran to them and
      wanted to eat them; I certainly had a right, since I was their father. Who
      would believe it! My cousin, my spouse, to whom I was willing to give her
      share <span class="pagenum">[460]</span><a name="link460" id="link460"></a>of
      the banquet, flew at my eyes. This brutality roused my indignation, and I
      strangled her on the spot; after which I swallowed the entire litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hapless little rogues were good for nothing, not even to nourish
      their father: their flabby flesh weighed on my stomach for three days.
      Disgusted with the strong passions, I gave up music, and returned to the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have thought much on the ideal happiness, and I think I have made
      thereupon some notable discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It evidently consists, in warm weather, in sleeping near the barnyard
      pool. A delicious odor arises from the fermenting dung; lustrous straws
      shine in the sunlight. The turkeys ogle lovingly, and let their crest of
      red flesh fall on their beak. The fowls scratch up the straw, and bury
      their broad bellies to take in the rising heat. The pool gleams, swarming
      with moving insects which make the bubbles rise to its surface. The harsh
      whiteness of the walls renders yet deeper the bluish recesses where the
      gnats hum. With eyes half closed you dream; and, as you have almost ceased
      to think, you no longer wish for anything. <span class="pagenum">[461]</span><a
      name="link461" id="link461"></a>In winter, happiness is in sitting at the
      fireside in the kitchen. The little tongues of flame lick the log and
      shoot amidst the sparks; the twigs snap and writhe, while the twisted
      smoke rises in the dark chimney to the very sky. Meanwhile the spit turns
      with a harmonious and pleasing ticktack. The fowl that is impaled reddens,
      turns brown, becomes splendid; the fat which moistens it softens its hues;
      a delightful odor irritates the olfactories; your tongue involuntarily
      caresses your lips; you take in the divine emanations of the fat; with
      eyes lifted to heaven in a serious transport, you wait till the cook takes
      off the creature and offers you the part that belongs to you.

      He who eats is happy, he who digests is happier, he who sleeps while
      digesting is happier still. All the rest is only vanity and vexation of
      spirit. The <span class="pagenum">[462]</span><a name="link462"
      id="link462"></a>fortunate mortal is he who, warmly rolled into a ball
      with his belly full, feels his stomach in operation and his skin expand. A
      delightful tickling penetrates and softly stirs the fibres. The outer and
      the inner creature enjoy with their every nerve. Surely if the universe is
      a great and blessed God, as our sages say, the earth must be an immense
      belly busy through all eternity digesting the creatures, and warming its
      round skin in the sun.

    <p>
      My mind has been greatly enlarged by reflection. By a sure method, sound
      conjectures and sustained attention, I have penetrated some of the secrets
      of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog is an animal so deformed, of such an unruly character, that from
      the earliest times it has been considered to be a monster, born and
      moulded in despite of all laws. Indeed, when rest is the natural state,
      how explain an animal that is forever in motion and busy, and that without
      aim nor need, even when he is gorged and not afraid? When beauty
      universally consists in suppleness, grace and prudence, how allow an
      animal to be forever brutal, howling, mad, jumping at the nose of people,
      running after kicks and rebuffs? When the favorite <span class="pagenum">[463]</span><a
      name="link463" id="link463"></a>and masterpiece of creation is the cat,
      how understand an animal that hates it, runs at it, without having
      received a single scratch from it, and breaks its ribs without any desire
      to eat its flesh?
    </p>
    <p>
      These contradictions prove that dogs are condemned beings; without a doubt
      the souls of the guilty and punished pass into their bodies. They suffer
      there; that is why they worry one another, and fret unceasingly. They have
      lost their reason, so they spoil everything, incite to battle, and are
      chained three-quarters of the day. They hate the beautiful and the good,
      consequently they try to throttle us.

      In this granary, my great-aunt used to say, there are troops of rats so
      fat that they can <span class="pagenum">[465]</span><a name="link465"
      id="link465"></a>hardly walk, and the more we eat of them, the more there
      are to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is evident that this is the opinion of poor devils, who, since they
      have never eaten anything but rat, cannot imagine a better diet. Besides,
      granaries are wood-color or gray, and the sky is blue, which finishes
      their confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, they rest their opinion upon a sufficiently shrewd remark:
      &ldquo;It is evident,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;that the sky is a granary of
      straw or flour, for there come out of it very often clouds light, as when
      the wheat is winnowed, or white, as when bread is sprinkled in the
      kneading-trough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I reply to them that the clouds are not formed by the chaff of grain
      or the dust of flour; for when they fall, it is water that we receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others, more refined, have maintained that the Dutch oven was God, saying
      that it is the fount of every blessing, turns unceasingly, goes to the
      fire without being burned, and that the sight of it is enough to throw one
      into ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion they have erred here only because they saw it through the
      window, from a distance, in a poetic, colored, sparkling smoke, beautiful
      as the sun at evening. But I, who have sat near it during whole hours, I
      know that it has to be sponged, mended, wiped; and in acquiring knowledge,
      I have lost the innocent illusions of heart and stomach. <span
      class="pagenum">[466]</span><a name="link466" id="link466"></a>The mind
      must be opened to conceptions more vast, and reason by more certain
      methods. Nature is everywhere uniform with herself, and in small things
      offers the image of the great.

      From what do all animals spring? from an egg; the earth then is a very
      great egg; I even add that it is a broken egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will convince yourself of this if you examine the form and the limits
      of this valley, which is the visible world. It is concave like an egg, and
      the sharp edges by which it rejoins the sky are jagged, are keen-edged and
      white like those of a broken shell.

    <p>
      The white and the yolk, pressed into lumps, have <span class="pagenum">[467]</span><a
      name="link467" id="link467"></a>formed these blocks of stone, these houses
      and the whole solid earth. Some parts have remained soft and form the
      surface that men plough; the rest runs in water and makes the pools, the
      rivers; each spring-time there runs a little that is new.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the sun, nobody can doubt its use; it is a great red firebrand that
      is moved back and forth above the egg to cook it gently; the egg has been
      broken on purpose, in order that it may be the better impregnated with the
      heat; the cook always does so. The world is a great beaten egg.

      Now that I have reached this stage of wisdom, I have nothing more to ask
      of nature, nor of men, nor of any one; except, perhaps, some little
      tidbits from the roaster. In future I have only to cradle myself to rest
      in my wisdom; for my perfection is sublime, and no thinking cat has
      penetrated into the secret of the world so far as I.

      CHAPTER IV. THE ROAD TO BA GNÈRES-DE-LUCHON.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>very man who has
      the use of his eyes and ears ought, in travelling, to climb up to the
      imperial. The highest places are the most beautiful; ask those who occupy
      them. You break your neck if you fall from them; consult the same people
      about this. But you enjoy yourself while you are there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, you see the landscape, which produces descriptions
      that you offer to the public. In the coupé, your only spectacle is the
      harness of the horses; in the interior, you see through a tiny window the
      trees trooping by like soldiers carrying arms; in the rotunda, you are in
      a cloud <span class="pagenum">[469]</span><a name="link469" id="link469"></a>of
      dust that dims the landscape and strangles the traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second place, at the top you will have comedy. In the lower places,
      the people preserve decorum and are silent. The peasants here perched
      aloft, who are your companions, the postilion and the conductor, make
      open-hearted confidences: they talk of their wives, their children, their
      property, trade, neighbors, and above all of themselves; so that at the
      end of an hour you imagine their housekeeping and their life as clearly as
      if you were at home with them. It is a novel of manners that you skim
      through on the road. Not one of them gives ideas so vivid and so truthful.
      You get to know the people only by living with them, and the people from
      three-quarters of the nation. These bits of conversation teach you the
      number of their ideas and the hue of their passions; now, on these ideas
      and passions depend all the great events. Besides their rude manners,
      their loud bursts of laughter, their frank respect for bodily strength,
      their acknowledged inclination for the pleasure of eating and drinking,
      offer a contrast to the humbug of our politeness and our affectation of
      refinement. The conductor told the postilion how the evening before they
      had eaten the half of a sheep among three of them. It was good, fat
      mutton; they served up no better at the Hotel of the Great Sun: <span
      class="pagenum">[470]</span><a name="link470" id="link470"></a>there were
      sirloins, cutlets, a neat leg of mutton. They had emptied six bottles. The
      other made him tell it over, and seemed to eat in imagination, by the
      reaction, by recoil, as it were.

      After the banquet, he had made the horses gallop; he had passed by
      Ribettes. Ribettes had swallowed dust for a whole hour; Ribettes wanted to
      get ahead again, but wasn&rsquo;t able. Ribettes grew very angry. They had
      dared Ribettes. The story of Ribettes and the mutton was told eight times
      in an hour, and seemed the last time as delightful and as new as the
      first. They laughed like the blest.

      In the third place, that is the only spot where you can breathe. The other
      divisions are sweating-rooms whose partitions and black cushions hold and
      concentrate the heat. Now, there is no man, no matter how he may love
      colors and lines, who can enjoy a landscape shut up in a box without air.
      When the creature is cramped, the soul is cramped. <span class="pagenum">[471]</span><a

      The coach starts very early in the morning and climbs a long ascent under
      the gray brightness of the dawn. The peasants come in troops; the women
      have five or six bottles of milk on the head, in a basket. Oxen, with
      lowered brows, drag carts as primitive and Gallic as at-Pau. The children,
      in brown <i>berets</i>, run in the dust, alongside their mothers. The
      village is coming to nourish the city.

      Escaladieu shows at the wayside the remains of an ancient abbey. The
      chapel is still standing and preserves fragments of gothic sculpture. A
      bridge is at the side, shaded by tall trees. The pretty river Arros runs,
      with <i>moiré</i> reflexes and guipures of silver, over a bed of dark
      pebbles. No one could choose a situation better than the monks: they were
      the artists of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mauvoisin, an ancient stronghold of robber-knights, lifts its ruined tower
      above the valley. Froissart relates how they besieged these honest folk;
      of a truth, in those times, they were as good as their neighbors, and the
      Duke of Anjou, their enemy, had done more harm than they. <span
      class="pagenum">[472]</span><a name="link472" id="link472"></a>"A Gascon
      squire, an able man-at-arms, named Raymonet de l&rsquo;Epèe, was at that
      time Governor of Malvoisin. There were daily skirmishes at the barriers,
      where many gallant feats were done by those who wished to advance
      themselves....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The castle of Malvoisin held out about six weeks, there were daily
      skirmishes between the two armies at the barriers, and the place would
      have made a longer resistance, for the castle was so strong it could have
      held a long siege; but the well that supplied the castle with water being
      without the walls, they cut off the communication: the weather was very
      hot, and the cisterns within quite dry, for it had not rained one drop for
      six weeks, and the besiegers were at their ease, on the banks of this
      clear and fine river, which they made use of for themselves and horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The garrison of Malvoisin were alarmed at their situation, for they
      could not hold out longer. They had a sufficiency of wine, but not one
      drop of sweet water. They determined to open a treaty; and Raymonet de l&rsquo;Epêe
      requested a passport to wait on the duke, which, having easily obtained,
      he said: &lsquo;My lord, if you will act courteously to me and my
      companions, I will surrender the castle of Malvoisin.&rsquo; &lsquo;What
      courtesy is it you ask?&rsquo; replied the Duke of Anjou:<span

      &ldquo;&lsquo;Get about your business each of you to his own country,
      without entering any fort that holds out against us; for if you do so, and
      I get hold of you, I will deliver you up to Jocelin, who will shave you
      without a razor.&rsquo; &lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; answered Raymonet, &lsquo;if
      we thus depart we must carry away what belongs to us, and what we have
      gained by arms and with great risk.&rsquo; The duke paused awhile, and
      then said, &lsquo;I consent that you take with you whatever you can carry
      before you in trunks and on sumpter horses, but not otherwise; and if you
      have any prisoners, they must be given up to us.&rsquo; &lsquo;I agree,&rsquo;
      said Raymonet. Such was the treaty, as you hear me relate it; and all who
      were in the castle departed, after surrendering it to the Duke of Anjou,
      and carrying all they could with them. They returned to their own country,
      or elsewhere, in search of adventures.&rdquo;

      These good folk who wished to keep the fruits of their labor, had spent
      their time &ldquo;in fleecing the merchants&rdquo; of Catalonia, as well
      as of France, &ldquo;and in making war on and harrying them of Bagnères
      and Bigorre.&rdquo; Bagnères was then &ldquo;a good, big, closed city.&rdquo;
      People fortified everywhere, because there was fighting everywhere. They
      went out only with a safe-conduct and an escort: instead of gendarmes they
      met plunderers; instead of umbrellas they carried off lances. A secure
      <span class="pagenum">[476]</span><a name="link476" id="link476"></a>house
      was a fine house; when a man had immured himself in a thick tower built
      like a well, he breathed freely, he felt at his ease. Those were the good
      old times, as every one knows.

      Encausse is very near here, at the turn of the road. Chapelle and
      Bachaumont came there to restore their stomachs, which needed and deserved

      and their style flows as easily as their life.

      They go by short stages, drink, chat, feast among the friends they have
      everywhere, court the ladies, make game very pleasantly of the provincial
      folk. They drink the health of the <span class="pagenum">[477]</span><a
      name="link477" id="link477"></a>absent, enjoy the muscatel as much as
      possible, and trifle in prose and verse. They are the epicureans of their
      time, easy poets who are troubled about nothing, not even about glory;
      graze all that they touch, and write only for their own amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Encausse,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;is far from all commerce, and a
      man can have no other diversion in it than that of watching the return of
      his health. A small stream that, a score of paces away from the village,
      winds among willows and the greenest fields imaginable, was our only
      consolation. We used to go every morning to take our water in this pretty
      spot, and after dinner to walk there. One day when we were on the brink,
      seated on the grass, there came suddenly from the midst of the reeds that
      were nearest a man who had apparently been listening to us; it was an old
      man, all white, pale and lean, whose beard and locks hung below his
      girdle, such (an one) as Melchisedec is painted; or rather the figure is
      that of a certain old Greek bishop, who, with many a salaam, tells
      everybody&rsquo;s fortune; for he wore a top-piece like a cauldron-lid,
      but of exceeding size, which answered him for a hat. And this hat, whose
      broad brim went drooping upon his shoulders, was made of branches of
      willow, and covered nearly all his body. His coat of greenish hue was
      woven of rushes, the whole <span class="pagenum">[478]</span><a
      name="link478" id="link478"></a>covered with great bits of a thick and
      bluish crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At sight of this apparition, fear caused us to make the sign of the
      cross twice over, and go three paces backward. But curiosity prevailed
      over fear, and we resolved, although with some little palpitation of
      heart, to await the extraordinary old man, whose approach was thoroughly
      courteous, and who spoke to us very civilly as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I am not surprised that with my unexpected appearance
      you should be a little startled in mind, but when you shall have learned
      in what rank the fates have set my birth to you unknown, and the motive of
      my coming, you will calm your minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">[479]</span><a name="link479" id="link479"></a>"I am
      the god of this stream, who, with an ever inexhaustible urn, tilted at the
      foot of that hill, take the task in this meadow of pouring unceasingly the
      water, which makes it so green and flowery. For eight days now, morning
      and evening, you come regularly to see me without thinking to pay me a
      visit. It is not that I do not deserve that you should pay me this
      respect; for, in short, I have this advantage, that a channel so pure and
      clear is the place of my appanage. In Gascony such a portion is very neat
      for a cadet.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum">[480]</span><a name="link480" id="link480"></a>The
      two travellers were talking of the tides of the Garonne, and of the
      reasons for them given by Gassendi and Descartes. This very obliging god
      relates to them how Neptune thereby punishes an ancient rebellion of the
      rivers. &ldquo;Then the honest river-god takes himself off, and when he
      has gone a score of paces the good soul is melted entirely into water.&rdquo;

      Nowadays this mythology seems unmeaning, and the thought flat. Look at the
      environs, the surroundings save it. Carelessness, intoxication, are on one
      side. It is born between two glasses of good wine thoroughly relished, in
      the midst of an unpremeditated letter. Are people so very nice at table?
      It is a refrain they are humming; flat or not, is of no consequence. The
      main thing is good humor and the inclination to laugh. I picture to myself
      the honest fellows, well-dressed, portly, their eyes still shining from
      the long dinner of yesterday, with rubies on their cheeks, perfectly ready
      to sit down to dine at the first inn and to bedevil the maid. La Fontaine
      did so, especially when he travelled. They made stops, forgot themselves,
      the broad jokes flew.<span class="pagenum">[481]</span><a name="link481"

      They didn&rsquo;t cross France as nowadays, after the fashion of a
      cannon-ball or an attorney; they allowed five days for going to Poitiers,
      and in the evening, on going to bed, they fed the body. It was the last
      age of the good corporeal life, that heavy <i>bourgoisie</i> which had its
      flower and its portrait in Flemish art. It was already disappearing;
      aristocratic propriety and lordly salutes were taking possession of
      literature; Boileau gave us serious verse, thoroughly useful and solid,
      like pairs of tongs. Nowadays when the middle-class man is a philosopher,
      ambitious, a man of business, it is far worse. Let us not speak ill of
      those who are happy; happiness is a sort of poetry; it is in vain that we
      boast ourselves, that poetry we have not.

      The road is bordered with vines, each of which carries up its tree, elm or
      ash, the crown of a fresh verdure, and lets its leaves and tendrils fall
      again in plumes. The valley is a garden long and narrow, between two
      chains of mountains. On the lower slopes are beautiful meadows where the
      living waters run in orderly fashion in trenches, nimble, prattling
      irrigators; the villages are seated <span class="pagenum">[484]</span><a
      name="link484" id="link484"></a>alone the little river; vine-stocks climb
      alone the dusty wall. The mallows, straight as tapers, lift above the
      hedges their round flowers, brilliant as roses of rubies. Orchards of
      apples pass continually on both sides of the coach; cascades fall in every
      hollow of the chain, surrounded with houses that seek a shelter. The heat
      and the dust are so terrible that they are obliged every time we pass a
      spring to sponge the nostrils of the horses. But at the end of the valley
      a mass of dark, rugged mountains lifts itself, with tops that are white
      with snow, feeding the river and closing the horizon. Finally, we pass
      beneath an alley of fine plane-trees, between two rows of villas, gardens,
      hotels, and shops. It is Luchon, a little city as Parisian as Bigorre.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he street is a
      broad alley, planted with large trees, and lined with rather handsome
      hotels. It was opened by the intendant d&rsquo;Ètigny, who, for this
      misdeed, was near being stoned. It was necessary to call in a company of
      dragoons to force the Luchonnais to endure the prosperity of their
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the alley a pretty chalet, like those in the Jardin des
      Plantes, shelters the <i>du Pr&rsquo;e</i> spring. Its walls are a
      fantastic trellis of gnarled branches, adorned with their bark; its roof
      is thatched; its ceiling is a tapestry of moss. A <span class="pagenum">[486]</span><a
      name="link486" id="link486"></a>young girl sitting at the taps distributes
      to the bathers glasses of sulphurous water. The elegant toilettes come
      about four o&rsquo;clock. Meanwhile you sit in the shade on benches of
      woven wood, and watch the children playing on the turf, the rows of trees
      descending toward the river, and the broad green plain, sprinkled with
      villages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below the spring are the bathing-houses, nearly finished, and which will
      be the finest in the Pyrenees. At present the neighboring field is still
      strewn with materials; the lime smokes all day, and makes the air to flame
      and quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court of the baths contains a large votive altar, bearing on one of
      its faces an amphora and this inscription:
    </p>

      There are several balls, and orchestras in certain cafés. These orchestras
      are strolling families, hired at so much a week, to make the house
      uninhabitable. One of these, composed of a flute, male, and four violins,
      female, used fearlessly to play the same overture every evening. The
      privileged beings <span class="pagenum">[488]</span><a name="link488"
      id="link488"></a>who had paid were in the hall among the music stands. A
      throng of peasants always crowded at the door, with open mouths; they
      formed in a circle and mounted on the benches to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tradespeople of every sort turn their shops into a lottery: lottery of
      plate, of books, of little objects of ornament, etc. The tradesman and his
      wife distribute cards, price one sou, to the servant-maids, soldiers, and
      children, who compose the crowd. Somebody draws; the gallery and those
      interested stretch their necks eagerly forward. The man reads the number;
      a cry is heard, the unguarded sign of an overflowing joy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      I that have won, I, monsieur the merchant.&rdquo; And you see a little
      serving-maid, blushing all over, lift herself on tiptoe and stretch out
      her hands. The merchant dexterously seizes a pot, parades it above his
      head, and makes everybody about remark it. &ldquo;A fine mustard-pot; a
      mustard-pot worth three francs, threaded with gold. Who wants numbers?&rdquo;
      The assembly lasts four hours. It begins anew every day; the customers are
      not wanting for a single moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      These people have a genius for display. One day we heard the roll of
      drums, followed by four men marching solemnly, swathed in shawls and
      pieces of cloth. The children and the dogs follow the procession with
      hubbub; it is the opening of a <span class="pagenum">[489]</span><a
      name="link489" id="link489"></a>new shop. The next day I copied the
      following handbill printed on yellow paper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orpheonic festival in the grotto of Gargas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Orpheonic Society from the city of Montrejean will execute

      &ldquo;Divers other pieces from the works of the great masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among other amateurs who will allow themselves to be heard, one
      will sing some stanzas on eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, an exquisite voice, which wishes to remain anonymous in
      order to avoid those deserved praises that people are fond of lavishing on
      its sex, will sing also a number of pieces analogous to the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be delicious and even seraphic to lend an ear to the echo
      of the sonorous concretions of the stalactites, which will unite with the
      vibrating echo of the vault to repeat the harmonious notes; and when the
      divine voice shall be heard, the intoxicating charm of the spell will
      surpass every impression which can have been left in the soul by the most
      delightful of musical reunions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price of admission: 1 franc.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These people are descendants of Clemence <span class="pagenum">[490]</span><a
      name="link490" id="link490"></a>Isaure. Their advertisements are odes. By
      way of compensation many odes are advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, you are here not far from Toulouse; like the character, the type
      is new. The young girls have fine, regular, clear-cut faces, of a lively
      and gay expression. They are small, with a light step, brilliant eyes, the
      nimbleness of a bird. In the evening, about a lottery-shop, these pretty
      faces stand out animated and full of passion beneath the flickering light,
      fringed with a black shadow. The eyes sparkle, the red lips tremble, the
      neck tosses with the little abrupt movements of the swallow; no picture
      can be more full of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you leave the lighted and tumultuous alley, at the distance of an
      hundred paces, you find silence, solitude and obscurity. At night, the
      valley is of great beauty; it is framed and drawn out between two chains
      of parallel mountains, huge pillars which stretch in two files and support
      the dark vault of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their arches mark it out like a cathedral ceiling, and the immense nave
      vanishes several leagues away, radiant with stars; these stars fling out
      flames. At this moment, they are the only living things; the valley is
      black, the air motionless; you can only distinguish the tapering tops of
      the poplars, erect in the tranquil night, wrapt in their mantle of leaves.
      The topmost branches stir, and <span class="pagenum">[491]</span><a
      name="link491" id="link491"></a>their rustle is like the murmur of a
      prayer echoed by the distant hum of the torrent.

      The valley is not a gorge, but a beautiful level meadow marked with trees
      and fields of maize, among which the river runs, but does not leap. Luchon
      is surrounded with alleys of plane-trees, poplars and lindens. You leave
      these alleys for a pathway which follows the waves of the Pique and winds
      amidst the high grass. The ashes and oaks form a screen along the two
      banks; big brooks come from the mountains; you cross them on trunks laid
      bridge-wise or on broad slabs of slate. All these waters <span
      class="pagenum">[492]</span><a name="link492" id="link492"></a>flow in the
      shade, between knotted roots which they bathe, and which form trellises on
      both sides. The bank is covered with hanging herbage; you see nothing but
      the fresh verdure and the dark waters. It is here that at noon the
      pedestrians take refuge; along the sides of the valley wind dusty roads
      where stream the carriages and the horsemen. Higher up, the mountains,
      gray or browned with moss, display their soft lines and noble forms as far
      as the eye can reach. They are not wild as at Saint Sauveur, nor bare as
      at Eaux-Bonnes; each of these chains advances nobly toward the city and
      behind it leaves its vast ridge to undulate to the very verge of the
      horizon.

      Above Luchon is a mountain called Super-Bagnères. At the outset I run
      across the Fountain of Love; it is a hut of planks where beer is sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      A winding staircase, crossed by springs, then steep pathways in a black
      forest of firs lead you in two hours to the pastures on the summit. The
      mountain is about five thousand feet high. These pastures are great
      undulating hills, ranged in rows, carpeted with short turf and thickset,
      fragrant thyme; here and there in crowds are broad tufts <span
      class="pagenum">[493]</span><a name="link493" id="link493"></a>of a sort
      of wild iris, the flower of which fades in the month of August.

      You reach there fatigued, and on the grass of the highest point you may
      sleep in the sunlight with the utmost pleasure in life. Clouds of winded
      ants eddied in the warm rays. In a hollow beneath us we heard the bleating
      of sheep and of goats. A quarter of a league <span class="pagenum">[494]</span><a
      name="link494" id="link494"></a>off, on the back of the mountain, a pool
      of water was glittering like burnished steel. Here, as on Mount Bergonz
      and the Pic du Midi, you look on an amphitheatre of mountains. These have
      not the heroic severity of the primal granite, black rocks clothed with
      luminous air and white snow. On one side alone, toward the Crabioules
      mountains, the naked and jagged rocks were silvered with a girdle of
      glaciers. Everywhere else, the slopes were without escarpment, the forms
      softened, the angles dulled and rounded. But, although less wild, the
      amphitheatre of the mountains was imposing. The idea of the simple and
      imperishable entered with an entire dominion into the subdued mind.
      Peaceful sensations cradled the soul in their mighty undulations. It
      harmonized itself with these huge and immovable creatures. It was like a
      concert of three or four notes indefinitely prolonged and sung by deep
      voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was declining, clouds dimmed the chilled sky. The woods, the
      fields, the mossy moors, the rocks of the slopes, took various hues in the
      waning light. But this opposition of hues, obliterated by distance and the
      greatness of the masses, melted into a green and grayish shade, of a
      melancholy and tender effect, like that of a vast wilderness half stocked
      with verdure. The shadows of the clouds travelled slowly, darkening the
      tawny summits. All <span class="pagenum">[495]</span><a name="link495"
      id="link495"></a>was in harmony, the monotonous sound of the wind, the
      calm march of the clouds, the waning of the day, the tempered colors, the
      softened lines.

      Here it is the second age of nature. The earth conceals the rocks, the
      mosses clothe the earth, the rounded undulations of the upheaved soil
      resemble the tired <span class="pagenum">[496]</span><a name="link496"
      id="link496"></a>waves an hour after the tempest. Luchon is not far from
      the plains; its mountains are the last billows of the subterranean storm
      which lifted the Pyrenees; distance has diminished their violence,
      tempered their grandeur, and softened their steeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward evening we descended into the hollow where the goats were passing.
      A spring was running there, caught in the hollowed trunks of trees which
      answered for watering-troughs to the herds. It is a delicious pleasure
      after a day&rsquo;s tramp to bathe hands and lips in the cold fountain.
      Its sound on this solitary plateau was charming. The water trickled
      through the wood, among the stones, and everywhere that it glided over the
      blackened earth the sun covered it with splendor. Lines of reeds marked
      its track to the brink of the pool. Herdsman and animals had gone down; it
      was the sole inhabitant of this abandoned field. Was it not singular to
      meet with a marsh at the height of five thousand feet?

      Toward the south the river becomes a torrent. Half a league from Luchon it
      is swallowed up in a deep defile of red rocks, many of which have fallen;
      the bed is choked with blocks; the two walls of rock close together in the
      north, and the dammed-up <span class="pagenum">[497]</span><a
      name="link497" id="link497"></a>water roars to get out of its prison; but
      the trees grow in the crevices, and along the wall the white flowers of
      the bramble hang in locks.

      Very near here, on a round eminence of bare rock, rises the ruin of a
      Moorish tower, named Cas-tel-Vieil. Its side is bordered with a frightful
      mountain, black and brown, perfectly bald and resembling a decayed
      amphitheatre; the layers hang one over another, notched, dislocated,
      bleeding; the sharp edges and fractures are yellowed with wretched moss,
      vegetable ulcers that defile with their leprous patches the nudity of the
      stone. The pieces of this <span class="pagenum">[498]</span><a
      name="link498" id="link498"></a>monstrous skeleton hold together only by
      their mass; it is crannied with deep fissures, bristling with falling
      blocks, broken to the very base; it is nothing but a ruin dreary and
      colossal, sitting at the entrance of a valley, like a battered giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an old beggar-woman there, with naked feet and arms, who was
      worthy of the mountain. For a dress she had a bundle of rags of every
      color sewn together, and remained the whole day long crouched in the dust.
      One might have counted the muscles and tendons of her limbs; the sun had
      dried her flesh and burned her skin; she resembled the rock against which
      she was sitting; she was tall, with large, regular features, a brow seamed
      with wrinkles like the bark of an oak, beneath her grizzled lids a savage
      black eye, a mat of white hair hanging in the dust. If a sculptor had
      wished to make a statue of Dryness, the model was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley narrows and ascends; the Gave rolls between two slopes of great
      forests, and falls in a constant succession of cascades. The eyes are
      satiated with freshness and verdure; the trees mount to the very sky,
      thickset, splendid; the magnificent light falls like a rain on the immense
      slope; the myriads of plants suck it in, and the mighty sap that gorges
      them overflows in luxury and vigor. <span class="pagenum">[499]</span><a

      On all hands the heat and thewater invigorate and propagate them; they
      accumulate; enormous beeches hang above the torrent; ferns people the
      brink; moss hangs in green garlands on the arcades of roots; wild flowers
      grow by families in the crevices of the beeches; the long branches go with
      a leap to the further brink; the water glides, boils, leaps from one bank
      to the other with a tireless violence, and pierces its way by a succession
      of tempests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further on some noble beeches climb the slope, forming an inclined plane
      of foliage. The sun gives lustre to their rustling tops. The cool shadow
      spreads its dampness between their columns, over the ribbons of sparse
      grass, and on strawberries red as coral. From time to time the light falls
      through an opening, and gushes in cataracts over their flanks which it
      illuminates; isles of brightness then cleave the dim depths; the topmost
      leaves move softly their diaphanous shade; the shadow almost disappears,
      so strong and universal is the splendor. Meanwhile a small hidden spring
      beads its necklace of crystal among the roots, and great velvet
      butterflies wheel in the air in broken starts, like falling
      chestnut-leaves.

      At the bottom of a hollow filled with plants, appears the hospice of
      Bagnères, a heavy house of stone, which serves as a refuge. The mountains
      open opposite it their amphitheatre of rock, a huge <span class="pagenum">[502]</span><a
      name="link502" id="link502"></a>and blasted pit; to crown the whole the
      clouds have gathered, and dull the rent enclosure which fences off the
      horizon&mdash;enclosure that winds with dreary air, perfectly barren, with
      the grinning army of its pinnacles, its raw cuts, its murderous steeps;
      beneath the dome of clouds, wheels a band of screaming crows. This well
      seems their eyry; wings are needed to escape the hostility of all those
      bristling points, and of so many yawning gulfs which draw on the passer in
      order to dash him to atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the road seems brought to an end; wall after wall, the serried rocks
      obstruct every outlet; still you advance, zigzag, among rounded blocks,
      along a falling stairway; the wind sweeps down these, howling. No sign of
      life, no herbage; everywhere the horrible nakedness and the chill of
      winter. Squat rocks lean beetling over the precipice; others project their
      heads to meet one another; between them the eye plunges into dark gulfs
      whose bottom it cannot reach. The violent juttings of all parts advance
      and rise, piercing the air; down there, at the bottom, they spring forward
      in lines, climbing over one another, in heaps, bristling against the sky
      their hedge of pikes. Suddenly in this terrible battalion a cleft is
      opened; the Maladetta springs up like a great spectre; forests of shivered
      pines wind about its foot; a girdle of black rocks embosses its arid
      breast, and the glaciers make it a crown.<span class="pagenum">[503]</span><a

      Nothing is dead, and in respect to this our feeble organs deceive us;
      those mountain skeletons seem to us inert because our eyes are used to the
      mobile vegetation of the plains; but nature is eternally alive, and its
      forces struggle together in these sepulchres of granite and snow, as well
      as in the <span class="pagenum">[506]</span><a name="link506" id="link506"></a>human
      hives or the most flourishing forests. Each particle of rock presses or
      supports its neighbors; their apparent immobility is an equilibrium of
      forces; everything works and struggles; nothing is calm and nothing
      uniform. Those blocks that the eye takes to be massive are networks of
      atoms infinitely removed from each other, drawn by innumerable and
      contrary attractions, invisible labyrinths where unceasing transformations
      are wrought out, where ferments the mineral life, as active as other
      lives, but grander. And ours, what is it, confined within the experience
      of a few years and the memory of a few centuries? What are we, but a
      transitory excrescence, formed of a little thickened air, grown by chance
      in a cleft of the eternal rock? What is our thought, so high in dignity,
      so little in power? The mineral substance and its forces are the real
      possessors and the only masters of the world. Pierce below this crust
      which sustains us as far as that crucible of lava which tolerates us. Here
      strive and are developed the great forces, the heat and the affinities
      which have formed the soil, have composed the rocks which support our
      life, have furnished its cradle for it, and are preparing its tomb.
      Everything here is transformed and stirs as in the heart of a tree; and
      our race, nested on a point of the bark, perceives not that silent
      vegetation which has lifted the trunk, spread the branches, <span
      class="pagenum">[507]</span><a name="link507" id="link507"></a>and whose
      invincible progress brings in turns flowers, fruits and death. Meanwhile a
      vaster movement bears the planet with its companions around the sun, borne
      itself toward an unknown goal, in the infinite space wherein eddies the
      infinite people of the worlds. Who will say that they are not there merely
      to decorate and fill it? These great rolling masses are the first thought
      and the broader development of nature; they live by the same right with
      ourselves, they are sons of the same mother, and we recognize in them our
      kin and elders.

      But in this family there are ranks. I know I am but an atom; to annihilate
      me, the least of these stones would suffice; a bone half as thick as my
      thumb is the wretched cuirass that defends my thought from delirium and
      death; my entire action and that of all the machines invented within sixty
      centuries would not avail to scrape one of the leaves of the mineral crust
      that supports and <span class="pagenum">[508]</span><a name="link508"
      id="link508"></a>nurtures me. And yet in this all-powerful nature I count
      for something. If among her works I am the most fragile, I am also the
      last; if she confines me within a corner of her expanse, it is in me that
      she ends. It is in me that she attains the indivisible point where she is
      concentred and perfected; and this mind through which she knows herself
      opens to her a new career in reproducing her works, imitating her order,
      penetrating her work, feeling its magnificence and eternity. In it is
      opened a second world reflecting the other, reflecting itself also, and,
      beyond itself and that other, grasping the eternal law which engenders
      them both. To-morrow I shall die, and I am not capable of displacing any
      portion of this rock. But during one moment I have thought, and within the
      limits of that thought nature and the universe were comprehended.

      country near Martres, you are delighted and breathe freely: you were

      horizon; you needed space. You felt that the air and light were usurped by
      those monstrous protuberances, and that you were not in a land of men, but
      in a land of mountains. Unknown to yourself you longed for a real
      champaign, free and broad. That of Martres is as level as a sheet of

      A highway white and flat led in a straight line to the very horizon, and

      In the streets there were Van Ostade&rsquo;s interiors. Old houses, roofs
      of uneven thatch, leaning one upon another, machines for hemp displayed in
      the doorways, little courtyards filled with tubs, wheelbarrows, straw,
      children, animals&mdash;a gay and well-to-do air; above all the great
      illuminator of the country, the universal decorator, the everlasting giver
      of joy, the sun poured in profusion its beautiful warm light over the
      walls of ruddy brick, and patched with strong shadows the white roughcast.

    <p>
      Toulouse appears, all red with bricks, amidst the red dust of evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      A melancholy city, with narrow and flinty streets. The town hall, called
      <i>Capicole</i>, has but one narrow entrance, commonplace halls, a
      pronounced and elegant façade in the taste of the decorations for public
      festivals. In order that no one may doubt its antiquity, they have
      inscribed on it the word <i>Capitolium.</i> The cathedral, dedicated to
      St. Stephen, is remarkable only for one pleasant memory:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards the year 1027,&rdquo; says Pierre de Marca,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the custom at Toulouse to box a Jew&rsquo;s ears in public
      on Easter day, in the Church of St. Stephen. Hugues, chaplain to Aimery,
      Viscount <span class="pagenum">[514]</span><a name="link514" id="link514"></a>de
      Rochechouart, being at Toulouse in his master&rsquo;s suite, dealt the Jew
      a blow with such force that it crushed his head and made his brains and
      eyes to fall out, as Adhémar has observed in his chronicle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The choir where Adhémar made this observation is wanting in neither beauty
      nor grandeur; but what strikes you most on leaving the mountains, is the
      museum. You find anew thought, passion, genius, art, all the most
      beautiful flowers of human civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a broad, well-lighted hall, flanked by two small galleries of
      greater height, which form a semicircle, and filled with pictures of all
      the schools, some of which are excellent. A Murillo, representing <i>St.
      Diego and his Monks</i>; you recognize in it the monastic harshness, the
      master&rsquo;s sentiment of reality, his originality of expression and
      earnest vigor. A <i>Martyrdom of St. Andrew,</i> by Caravaggio, black and
      horrible. Several pictures by the Caracci, Guercino and Guido. A <i>Ceremony
      of the Order of the Holy Ghost</i> in 1635, by Philip de Champagne. These
      most real, delicate and noble faces are portraits of the time; you see the
      contemporaries of Louis XIII. in life. Here are the correct drawing,
      temperate color, conscientious but not literal exactness of a Fleming
      become a Frenchman. <span class="pagenum">[515]</span><a name="link515"

      A charming <i>Marquise dc Largillere</i> with a wasp waist in blue velvet,
      elegant and haughty. A <i>Christ Crucified,</i> by Rubens, the eyes
      glassy, flesh livid&mdash;a powerful sketch, wherein the cold whiteness of
      the faded tints exhales the frightful poetry of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      I name only the most striking; but the liveliest sensation comes from the
      modern pictures. They transport the mind all at once to Paris, into the
      midst of our discussions, into the inventive and troubled world of the
      modern arts, the immense laboratory where so many fruitful and opposing
      forces weave the work of a renewing century: A celebrated picture by
      Glaize, the <i>Death of St. John the Baptist</i>; the half-naked butcher
      who holds the head is a superb brute, a careless instrument of death which
      has just done its work well. An elegant and affected painting by Schoppin,
      <i>Jacob before Laban and his two Daughters</i>. The daughters of Laban
      are pretty drawing-room misses who have just disguised themselves as
      Arabs. <i>Muley Abd-el-Rhaman,</i> by Eugene Delacroix. He is motionless
      on a bluish and melancholy horse. Files of soldiers are presenting arms,
      packed in masses in a stifling atmosphere; dull heads, stupid and real,
      hooded with the white bournous; ruined towers are piled behind them under
      a leaden sun. The crude colors, the heavy garments, bronzed limbs, massive
      parasols, that lifeless and animal<span class="pagenum">[518]</span><a
      name="link518" id="link518"></a> expression are the revelation of a land
      where thought sleeps overwhelmed and buried under the weight of barbarism,
      of the religion and the climate. In a corner of the small gallery is the
      first brilliant stroke of Couture, <i>The Thirst of Gold.</i> All misery
      and every temptation come to solicit the miser: a mother and her starving
      child, an artist reduced to beggary, two half-nude courtesans. He gazes at
      them with sorrowful ardor, but the hooked fingers cannot let go the gold.
      His lips shrivel, his cheeks glow, his burning eyes are fastened to their
      wanton bosoms. It is the torture of the heart torn by the rebellion of the
      senses, the concentrated despair of repressed desire, the bitter tyranny
      of the ruling passion. Never did face better express the soul. The drawing
      is bold, the color superb, more daring than in the <i>Romans of the
      Decadence</i>, so lively that you forget to notice a few crude tones,
      hazarded in the transport of composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps too much praise. All these moderns are poets who have
      determined to be painters. One has sought out dramas in history, another
      scenes of manners; one translates religions, another a philosophy. Such an
      one imitates Raphael, such another the early Italian masters; the
      landscapist employs trees and clouds to compose odes or elegies. No one is
      simply a painter; they are all archaeologists, psychologists, giving
      setting to <span class="pagenum">[519]</span><a name="link519" id="link519"></a>some
      memory or theory. They please our learning, our philosophy. Like
      ourselves, they are full and overflowing with general ideas, Parisians
      uneasy and curious. They live too much by the brain, and too little by the
      senses; they have too much wit and too little artlessness. They do not
      love a form for its own sake, but for what it expresses; and if they
      chance to love it, it is voluntarily, with an acquired taste, from an
      antiquary&rsquo;s superstition.

      They are children of a wise generation, harassed and thoughtful, in which

      for himself his religion, rank, <span class="pagenum">[520]</span><a

      away from the first masters, workmen or cavaliers, who lived out-of-doors,
      scarcely read at all, and thought only of giving a feast for their eyes.
      It is for that that I love them; I feel like them because I am of their

      Below the museum is a square tower enclosed by a gallery of slender
      columns, which towards the top bend and are cut into trefoils, forming a
      border of arcades. They have gathered under this gallery all the
      antiquities of the country: fragments of Roman statues, severe busts of
      emperors, ascetic virgins of the middle ages, bas-reliefs from churches
      and temples, knights of stone lying all armed upon their tombs. The court
      was deserted and silent; tall slender trees, tufted shrubbery, were bright
      with the loveliest green. A dazzling sunlight fell on the red tiles of the
      gallery; an old fountain, loaded with little columns and heads of animals,
      murmured near to a bench of rose-veined marble. A statue of a young man
      was seen amidst the branches; stems of green hops climbed up around broken
      columns.<span class="pagenum">[521]</span><a name="link521" id="link521"></a>
